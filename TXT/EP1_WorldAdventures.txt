   [0017] 0x97AB1C613DB4AF49: Take a load off in this chair designed for a king! Even though no king has ever thought it a fancy enough chair for royalty, it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the first!
   [0018] 0x4576BF1F807A6F7B: Beautify your home, or tomb, with this ancient relic!

   [001C] 0xB839C99E55E6F923: When first created over 100 years ago, these doors were used by royalty in their palaces and mansions. Today, most common Sims can afford them because they’re pretty much just rustic looking.
   [001D] 0xF3F92BBC1D8AA792: Cedric Von Hertzheim’s passion for doors and entryways really shines in this set of double doors. Most Sims agree these doors are the pinnacle of Cedric’s work before moving on to wallpaper design.
   [001E] 0xA806FC53743BA320: Custom built for the locals of Shang Simla, this door has recently come on the market to door buyers worldwide. Enjoy this door in your home today!
   [001F] 0xCE2A8176DDDB76ED: After emigrating from Al Simhara to Pleasantview, Amine Hayuk started up the local Al Simharan Carpenter’s Union. This is the first door to be completely built through unionized labor.
   [0020] 0x7FA1170CAA517221: Designed with disrespectful teenagers in mind, this quasi door, quasi arch way, allows teenagers to have the feeling of their own space, without being able to completely seal themselves off. A much better alternative to just taking a door off its hinges.
   [0021] 0x3E55F2AB975D255E: For those of you out there seeking hi-tech passageways with low-tech looks, TombTech has built this door just for you. With patent pending SimSensing technology, these seemingly ancient tomb doors automatically open and close for your Sim.
   [0022] 0xD0A2F6268D5C0302: The slat door should be considered more of a gateway than a door. It does seal off access between two rooms, but the same can't be said for smell and sound.
   [0023] 0x7AC89334DA95F760: When the standard Tomb Passage just doesn’t have the right feel, install the deluxe version that has much more embellishment, and thus much more style.
   [0024] 0xE66C576E789F5BB4: It might not taste great, but let me tell you, it sure is loaded with carbs! It's a great pick me up when you need some energy.

   [0026] 0xE26E788DE7034F6B: Inspired by the great gate inventor Nardone, this gate is action-packed with plenty of design and common functionality.
   [0027] 0x172737CF916CF589: Designed and manufactured in Champs Les Sims, this gate portrays the feeling of a field full of gates. Not fences though, just gates.

   [0032] 0xECF59B67A10EBFFE: Comte LeClair bet and lost his entire fortune. Throughout his life there was only one thing that he refused to risk—a country home that featured a charming garden fountain of which he was most fond. Now you too can experience that affection with this authentic replica of the devotion-inspiring fountain.
   [0033] 0xBC9B870F0C87880B: You don’t know what the figure is in this statue—and we don’t either. But it must have been important because someone put it in a fountain. And, with no obvious history to contradict you, imagine the fun you’ll have making up stories about what it was and what its—daring? absurd? romantic?—exploits were!
   [0034] 0xFEF08B473EA25654: Before incense holders, there was the Incense Holder. A man was actually paid to come to your house and hold incense for you. His job became obsolete around the same time as the milk man.
   [0035] 0xE06DDE56112031F6: Inscription Plaques are great for tombs or basements!
   [0036] 0x1F4468BCA4538488: This hanging bowl light is a classic example of Brahman's unique knack for lighting design. Either that, or his cheap knack for lighting design.
   [0037] 0x59D9AA5D2DF2FF94: This is one special stick. Or at least it was when ancient Sims first discovered that it could harness the power of the sun. When they found out other materials could burn as well, they downgraded it to just a “Sun Stick.” This model was created in memory of when it was still magical.
   [0038] 0x74B5B8169ACDABDA: Use it to welcome you home at the end of a long day, turn it on to let passersby know you’re home, or maybe you just want to chase away a dark corner on your front stoop. However you use it, this little lamp will be there for you day (when you may not even notice it) and night!
   [0039] 0x81D40B2CA13BBC32: This version of the Laissez-faire Light Post comes with not one, but two street lights to light your night. It has also been upgraded to resist any regulations put on it to keep it out of the free market.
   [003A] 0xEC38F735E2E6D7DD: Francois spent the late hours of his days writing magnificent poems by the light of this lamp. Unfortunately the light bulb broke once, setting his house ablaze. His poems are now lost to history.
   [003B] 0x54AA9E1A9FE43848: This object is a hidden lever disguised as a torch. It can be used to trigger certain events in a tomb.
   [003C] 0xC9302D14087CFF2A: Sure, there are better ways to light a room than with a torch. And sure, there are much safer ways as well. But when did those safer and more efficient ways ever provide you the soft glow of an open flame that you desire?
   [003D] 0x5A0FA2B5683E7906: Deed description
   [003E] 0x409722CC9B30999E: For all of its days, this park bench has longed to be a loveseat. It waits desperately for lovers to come sit upon it.

   [0045] 0xAF6525FD1507C728: This mirror tempts even the vainest of Sims to admire its elegant construction over their own reflection. Vanity is in the eye of the beholder!
   [0046] 0x2A386321BE6E87D1: A traditional Nectar glass.
   [0047] 0xF180F90893E26377: A tray for serving Nectar.
   [0048] 0x38F805DCAFFE02F8: This piece was completed by Han Shin just weeks before his untimely death. Ironically, friends say he somehow meant it to symbolize eternal life.
   [0049] 0x5F89AB0019FC9155: The world has few vistas that are more breathtaking than a view of the great pyramids at sunrise.
   [004A] 0xF2A15EDBFEBDB7D1: Painted by the legendary French artiste Jerome, this painting is a vivid memory of his early years as a poor farm boy.
   [004B] 0x9A9582BD30660B77: This axe, formed from the strongest materials on earth and then blessed by monks of The Clan of the Resolute Fist, has the strength to crush anything that stands in its way.
   [004C] 0x9DC9EBDDF05FD41E: Usually found near water, Bulrushes were considered to be super lily pads by early inhabitants due to their large size.
   [004D] 0x987243702679E6D4: No, it does not light up. But it does grow small flowers that look like a lantern!
   [004E] 0x3F549AD4DE846F13: No one likes weeds, but who could hate them with a name like Fern?

   [0051] 0xCC515668EA6232C2: Yellow enthusiasts proclaim that this is the best type of Lilac. Why wouldn't they?
   [0052] 0x006DA33A8F9A0122: This popular perennial is sure to make your planter pop!
   [0053] 0xF9E434EC82FC831D: Chinese water lilies are best known for their ability to support large creatures on the surface of the water. This does NOT mean large Sims.
   [0054] 0xEBE0F35A3E2CC350: Among other things, pushable statues can be used to trigger switches or disarm traps.
   [0055] 0xFB7E7547DF10C66C: Use this object to spawn treasure.

   [0059] 0xC21AC165FC35F719: Even if its great performance and high fuel efficiency doesn’t sell you on it, The Kenspa’s classic looks and edgy flair certainly add much more buying appeal.
   [005A] 0x8B07CD2C93626F86: Use this accent to give your roof the custom look you’ve always wanted, but never been able to afford!
   [005B] 0x68FEECAA66ABD0AC: Some say it's the head, some say it's the tail, some say it's both. Either way, this ferocious dragon head/tail is going to town on this piece of roof artwork. Look out!
   [005C] 0xB4999844FB6F733F: What's better than a real umbrella? A sculpture of an umbrella! It gives it class...
   [005D] 0xB1E9DA5005E55061: This vase so resembles a fountain gushing with flowers that it inspired film director M. Wohlert to include a CG rendering of a heroic flower fountain in his latest Sci-Fi epic.

   [0073] 0xE3C0BD7AB1342240: Palm trees represent life in the desert, for there must be water nearby for them to live.

   [0075] 0xE69EC4A0BA46746B: Shrubs are a great and simple way to beautify your yard.
   [0076] 0x70A863C7B5F5FAE3: This product is a window. Or is it a garden? No one can quite tell for sure as it was originally marketed as a garden view window until the garden came to the window, and in fact, became the window!
   [0077] 0x792D726460C70234: King Qing was the first emperor of the Second Dynasty to install glass windows in the Palatial Palace. Previous emperors had to weather windstorms, monsoons, and the occasional barbarian attack without the peace and quiet of a fully sealed restroom.
   [0078] 0xF67BA172F61D84EC: Unlike many of its competing products, this viewing screen comes with a subscription service.

   [0079] 0x4851764BEBF120A8: Do dust storms keep getting sand in your shawarma? Foliage in your falafel? Install the Desert Shield in your open-air house today and keep the desert out while still retaining the natural beauty of the outside world!

   [007B] 0x6FBA4F8E5CFB1553: It’s a well known fact that the super fine grains of sand found only in the Simomian Desert make the best window glass. Unfortunately, this window doesn’t use that sand. In fact, it’s actually more of a novelty decoration than anything else.
   [007C] 0x2DC303854415BB91: Hello and Goodbye!! Glass shapers designed this window for the specific use of waving hello or goodbye to guests at your residence.

Unfortunately, Landgraab was a rampant conspiracy theorist and worrywart and his home is shut up tighter than Napoleon’s tomb. Take this key to his library and try to find the papers. It should be near the front of his home. Please be careful!”

   [1080] 0x70256D795C0B5862: To really get into our music you have to understand that it is steeped in history and tradition. To feel the legacy of the ages that have pressed themselves perfectly into each note is to reach the epiphany that you seek.
   [1081] 0x70256D795C0B5863: Honestly I don't really like the music here. It bores me.
   [1082] 0x70256D795C0B5864: Between you and me, it feels like our music is based on old cinema inspired iconic representation using traditional orchestration. It’s almost as if the music being played was made specifically for the setting and feeling of Al Simhara itself!
