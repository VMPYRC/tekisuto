   [133] 0x293FE44F618BB813: A classic garden shrub grown to its maximum height! Requires no more care than a smaller Burford Holly, and is far better at blocking out your nosy neighbors.
   [134] 0x7F3F5083CE1F4E20: With a slender trunk and long delicate branches, the Aspen tree is a picturesque accompaniment to any natural landscape—or any arcology garden decks trying to pass as natural.

   [136] 0x0458C1000E774F8A: The Red Maple is a woodland staple. Take a chance while you’re able: buy one for your yard before they’re all turned into tables and the forest’s just a fable.
   [137] 0x783926205F8684EE: Experience the Future in heart-stopping holographic detail! Corebital’s newest piece of holographic technology displays incredible images from a single projector unit. A whole new dimension of entertainment awaits.

   [140] 0xCF9C4113E91F515D: It’s an accepted fact of modern optics that light, being both a particle and a fluid, flows more smoothly through circular windows than any other shape.
   [141] 0x51A7D8135779440D: Light flows best through circular apertures, but all that glass still gets in the way. For the Sim truly devoted to illumination, the Hollow Sun is the only option.
   [142] 0x56BCE5C7F8840199: Everyone likes natural lighting but few enjoy the exposure of full length windows. The Peephole whacks two llamas with one club, letting the Sims inside carefully survey their surroundings.
   [143] 0x89424FC288048469: Add an aura of intrigue to your home with these paired parallel windows. You could walk around wearing only your shoes and no one would know!
   [144] 0x4EEDA2A53BE54E25: For the Sim who cares deeply about tanning their calves, this ultra-low window provides just a thin sliver of brilliant light on the floor.

   [652] 0xC96688C02B3D4D54: With a whine of speeding turbines, the Defensive Grid comes online! You’ve stopped the meteors, for now.
   [653] 0x4A97E367EE4949C0: The Defensive Grid shields the region from falling meteors. It requires a heap of Gems and Metals to turn it on to protect the citizens of Oasis Landing!
   [654] 0x4ADA83BD2A66623C: As long as the Defensive Grid remains inactive, meteors will continue to pulverize Oasis Landing.
   [655] 0x730527E346D2E3AF: Mightier than Meteors
   [656] 0x3801A5B81E925BEB: Bring Gems and Metals to the Observatory.
   [657] 0x8F34B6A2A255D64E: Thank you so much for the Trait Chips! These will do nicely. Here’s your payment.
   [658] 0xB569C61DF773884A: There’s word around town that you’ve been building some quality Trait Chips. If you’d hammer out a few chips for me, I’d pay you well!
   [659] 0xFED1438ABC6E354A: Too bad, I was really hoping you’d make me some Trait Chips
   [65A] 0x2AE0DADECC325E35: Silicon Slinger
   [65B] 0xC49773E1CF215CC5: Deliver Trait Chips to {2.SimName}.

   [65D] 0xEAF16C81A00AD5BB: Any amateur plumboticist can slap some components together and declare the monstrosity a Plumbot. Real artisans put their creations to the ultimate test in the Bot Arena!
   [65E] 0x10A03A254AF4D933: You decided that when it comes to robotics, you’re more of a hobbyist than a competitor.
   [65F] 0x55D2ECF6464D029A: Test Your Metal
   [660] 0x324BC7C12353DECA: Build a Bot for an Arena Competition.
   [661] 0xF63DC67F67DB31F0: You saved the day by figuring out those Bots were stuck in a toilet-sink logic loop!
   [662] 0xD4E8404CB53FEE74: The janitorial Plumbots at City Hall have gone haywire! The maintenance team tries their hardest, but they’re woefully under-funded and they need your help to avert an uprising.
   [663] 0x66445E3F703FDFB8: Plumbots are complicated machines, so you’ve decided not to get involved in their complicated problems.
   [664] 0x2C69BEF07704E37B: Bots Going Berserk
   [665] 0xDCA6A3BDA8F077E7: Go to {OpTarget}.

   [667] 0xA41636AD68190EE5: The local Bot Arena is hosting a major international event! They’ve put out a call for robotically inclined Sims who’d like to volunteer and improve their skills.
   [668] 0x0B0A37E078463099: A day in the noise, heat and smell of a Plumbot maintenance pit doesn’t appeal to you.

   [66B] 0xE0BA024F6ABE93EC: Riding the Windcarver is much faster than walking!
   [66C] 0x897E80938EC379C8: With the invention of the Windcarver, there’s no need to walk anywhere! Take a Windcarver for a ride and see how you like it.
   [66D] 0xF385F799B90A6A24: You weren't in the mood for riding the Windcarver.
   [66E] 0xD89EA67CA88C6D81: Ride the Windcarver for a few hours.

   [678] 0xD978D39B827A1272: It’s one thing to play the Laser Harp well; you have the talent to play very well. It’s time for a stage befitting your potential: the local Theater!
   [679] 0x711BDEE383D417F2: Everyone gets stage jitters, especially with such a complicated instrument. Keep practicing!

   [67D] 0x204A33704F5C9363: The Laser Harp is best enjoyed as the accompaniment to a fine meal. Show off your skills by playing a show for the diners at a local restaurant.
   [67E] 0xFC5CC64937F8BC5B: You decided not to play your Laser Harp for the diners while they eat.

   [687] 0xD871443CD56B82ED: What’s the point of a musical gift if you don’t share it? Play your Laser Harp for Sims far and wide! Earn some Simoleons while you’re at it.
   [688] 0x80F2D16123358421: You decided more practice was needed before gathering up the courage to perform in public.

   [68C] 0xB3AA3D27B02B10AA: Every song is difficult when playing a four-limbed instrument, but you just learned a new one!
   [68D] 0x2AE428A08E9EA7DE: Learning any single song on the Laser Harp takes a long time, but virtuosos must learn a wide variety of compositions to win the public’s respect.
   [68E] 0x88E641B4C8A0FC56: You already knew plenty of songs on the Laser Harp so there was no need to learn another.
   [68F] 0x4A15FC6789CF1241: Expand your Chromatic Catalogue
   [690] 0xB313A8B7B4B8FEC1: Learn a new Laser Harp composition.
   [691] 0x309B33AA82BF9175: Magnificent specimens! See the fine articulation in their leg joints? It’s connected to tiny artificial muscles.
   [692] 0x88CB33911755B6BB: Plumbots have a fascinating and surprising history! They didn’t progress from automated vacuum cleaners; instead they evolved almost naturally. Hobbyist Sims built and collected insectoid robots called Nanites, eventually releasing them into the wild. I’ll explain more once you’ve caught some for me.
   [693] 0xF3F65DA9AC062A33: Wow, it looks like you already know all there is to know about Bots!
   [694] 0x1080252EC8DB9110: Catch {1.Number} Nanites.

   [697] 0xC9DEA442BE44F14E: Once reversed engineered a Nanite, their almost natural beauty comes into focus.
   [698] 0x53438D2D6EBE694A: Wild Nanites are a good introduction to the subject of modern robotics, since their small and simple systems are writ large in sophisticated Plumbots. To better understand how these systems interact, I recommend dissecting and Reverse Engineering a Nanite.
   [699] 0xD6E2C01747325135: Nanite Dissection
   [69A] 0x2146CDD2BF8DFFC5: Reverse Engineer a Nanite from your inventory.
   [69B] 0x90C588F2BB975B73: Plumbot Competitions are the best. I needed to change my lab coat after my first Arena visit!
   [69C] 0x4E8BBC464F84B589: Since Plumbots grew out of avid hobbyist communities, they saw their first action in competition. Down at the Bot Arena, Plumbots grind themselves to pieces striving for glory; it’s not inhumane because Plumbots aren’t human. Watch a Bot Competition for yourself. They’re tons of fun!
   [69D] 0xA660F621FB9600AC: Oilsport
   [69E] 0x703176D48F7C9888: Watch a Plumbot Competition.
   [69F] 0xE65F33F80F8C9924: Once you’ve played around with your new Plumbot, you’ll wonder how you ever got by without one.
   [6A0] 0xAE15982FAA383670: Plumbots may have started as idle curiosities, but they’ve become an enormous part of Oasis Landing’s economy and social fabric. Nobody goes a day without interacting with Plumbots! It’s a beautifully natural social experiment, so I’d like you to purchase a Plumbot of your own.
   [6A1] 0xBF50A404FEA6973F: A Serious Investment
   [6A2] 0x4C21B96934C76F1B: Purchase a Plumbot from a Sales Pedestal.
   [6A3] 0x15AA60DEB136BBC9: Perfect! As you can see, Plumbots are just like organic Sims, only more helpful and less whiny.
   [6A4] 0x7E3B8CFB66E49187: That’s a fine Plumbot you selected! They function best when calibrated slowly and deliberately. Let’s put it through its paces. Instruct your Bot to Explain its Function, then Instruct it to Entertain You. I’ll keep all my scanners running while you do this…for science!
   [6A5] 0xA5B1F210517CE93E: Iterating Introductions
   [6A6] 0xA8FE088A32D0FEEE: Instruct Plumbot to Explain its Function and then to Entertain You.
   [6A7] 0x8437F6271B72B7F2: There’s no feeling quite like being elbow-deep in a Plumbot’s thought center, is there?
   [6A8] 0x32013BC93930A9D6: When Sims got bored of Plumbots just performing domestic chores, they invented Trait Chips capable of modifying nearly any Bot function! There are even chips to simulate romantic love and sentience. Open your Plumbot up and adjust its Trait Chips to appreciate the dramatic difference.
   [6A9] 0x64B67FF839A8CBE9: Altered Traits
   [6AA] 0xC7606595D72989D9: Adjust Plumbot’s Trait Chips.
   [6AB] 0xAD50CB396A6344C7: There’s nothing quite like a Body Massage from unyielding metal fingers, is there? How invigorating!
   [6AC] 0x41EFFDBCDF63EFE5: My favorite part of Plumbot history is how relationships between humans and Plumbots developed. We started by manipulating their Trait Chips, but eventually the Mood Adjuster Trait Chip let Plumbots affect human emotions! To experience this yourself, Instruct your Bot to give a Body Massage.
   [6AD] 0xB6CBF5FF417FE8A0: Cyborg Chiropractic
   [6AE] 0x985230FF9D198DAC: Receive Body Massage from Plumbot.
   [6AF] 0xB84E64FAC991F5E8: Great woolly llamas, your devotion is amazing! Enjoy your new Charging Station!
   [6B0] 0x9827A5C3A3B4513C: Thank you ever so much for your patience, taking this personal journey through Plumbot history. Most Sims are happy to see these remarkable creatures as mere tools. Come and see me; I’ve build you a few Trait Chips to encourage further exploration. For science!
   [6B1] 0x632DA3E68ED65433: Assembly Complete
   [6B2] 0x0D6F996353F2C22F: Talk to the Time Traveler.
   [6B3] 0x9FF3C6C43DFCEECD: Great woolly llamas, your stamina is amazing! Your devotion to acquiring knowledge inspires me every day.
   [6B4] 0x031EF7E504FBCDA3: Thank you ever so much for your patience, taking this personal journey through Plumbot history. Most Sims are happy to see these remarkable creatures as mere tools. Come and see me; I’ll give you a Charging Station. After all, Plumbots are useless with an empty battery!
   [6B5] 0x7F01060979605FFE: How was meeting your Descendants? Thank goodness you didn’t explode from some kind of temporal paradox!
   [6B6] 0x23F071A8808A2ADA: In my research of this timeline, I noticed that Sims descended from you played an outsized role in Oasis Landing’s development. This could be a coincidence, or perhaps the product of magnificent genes. Meet your own Descendants; see if they seem remarkable in any way.
   [6B7] 0xBE14B59D00BE549A: If you’re uncomfortable meddling with your own Descendants’ lives, I won’t pressure you to continue.
   [6B8] 0xCF02C5B1C69FD5E5: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?
   [6B9] 0x33A7E5E0B64A9F15: Greet a Descendant.
   [6BA] 0x366B8C9727609165: I see you’ve returned safely to your own time. Make any personal or family alterations you like!
   [6BB] 0xC23C4999C1847F8B: Now that we’ve got a basic understanding of your Descendants, we can start experimenting! Try to dramatically alter your family’s net wealth, permanently change some traits, or adjust the number of Sims living in your household. The changes won’t take effect until you return to your original timeline, for reasons that should be obvious.
   [6BC] 0x252E57CA7B750E8A: Changing your Stars
   [6BD] 0x774CD5B96980D25A: Travel back in time to the present day and alter your net wealth, traits, or family size.
   [6BE] 0xF57375508F97A320: Welcome back, weary traveler! Once you’ve recovered from your inter-dimensional journey, you’ll see your new household.
   [6BF] 0x330A0947683D5BC4: Wonderful! Using my tachyon scanners, I’ve traced your signal back through time and isolated your family line. Get your personality and household to a finished state, and then rejoin me in the future. I’m so excited to see what these changes have wrought!
   [6C0] 0xCFB2E9C370BAD62B: Return to the Post-Present
   [6C1] 0x7607AFA2D43CE137: Travel to the Future and speak with the Time Traveler.
   [6C2] 0xB56C90244B175BF7: Hopefully, you’re enjoying that altered household. If not, simply jump back to the past and try again!
   [6C3] 0x24C400668011ECF5: Now that you’ve shifted your own genetic timeline, your Descendants may have been radically altered or absent entirely! For all my tachyon-inferred data, we won’t have hard conclusions until you meet with them again. Remember, some changes will be subtler than others.
   [6C4] 0xB2533B99C3D2B5D0: The Moment of Truth
   [6C5] 0x97894928007725FC: Greet a Descendant.
   [6C6] 0x49BD2657F7A4C18C: Was Trash diving as fun as it looks? Tell me about it while I scan you…
   [6C7] 0x6F409F6A1394C7E8: This Dystopia timeline might disgust you, but the Sims here seem fairly happy with their lot. We should test out exactly how unhealthy Dystopia’s various features are. Start out simple and stinky: play in one of the Trash Piles littering the landscape. Get it? “Littering!”
   [6C8] 0x774FCD9899345744: Seems like you’ve already experienced a dystopian Future before. Check back later if you’re still interested in helping me!
   [6C9] 0xE433EB459F9A2A27: Sullied Samples
   [6CA] 0xDD9D0E5813C587F3: Play in a Trash Pile.
   [6CB] 0x1FAFE60AC6BC4D4F: Don’t those bugs have a delightful crunch? And the nutty flavor! Yes, I’ve tried a few myself.
   [6CC] 0xAA53E9ADBB86A67D: You’ve shown no ill effects from the Trash Piles, aside from some odor. Let’s get a little more exotic! I’ve observed Sims eating the local insects, so they’re probably not poisonous. Catch and consume a few Bugs, to test their flavor and nutritional content.
   [6CD] 0x22B0083AF22E77F6: Catch and Eat {1.Number} Bugs.
   [6CE] 0x34C15D3AFCA03F28: The Local Flavor
   [6CF] 0x5740C86CC709DDE4: Caught and Eaten {0.Number} of {1.Number} Bugs.
   [6D0] 0x188ED94F0739565A: Great woolly llamas, the third eye tracks my movement! It sees just fine, like the others.
   [6D1] 0x9B0A02EF9685D36E: According to my readouts, you absorbed a good amount of protein on your eating expedition. Let’s see if the other local fauna are similarly healthy. Catch me a few Three-Eyed fish. That extra eye might not be the freakish mutation I assumed it was.
   [6D2] 0xACE3D433D5CEC7E3: Catch {1.Number} Three-Eyed Fish near Floating Trash Piles.
   [6D3] 0xE2AAE733F4C76F71: Nature’s Little Blunders
   [6D4] 0x9F3B3AAF9407D011: Catch some Three Eyed Fish
   [6D5] 0x0C6A3758CB17873D: What did you find in the Geyser Rift? I’ve heard about priceless gems and powerful gamma rays!
   [6D6] 0xD18D686E790BAE33: Those fish checked out; healthy down to their cell chemistry. Most of Dystopia’s problems seem more like ugly quirks! If you don’t mind a bit of real danger, I’d like you to explore the Geyser Rifts caused by falling Meteors.
   [6D7] 0x25DF396F6188CEE2: Geyser Spelunking
   [6D8] 0x200A3083BD767FA2: Explore a Geyser Rift.
   [6D9] 0x03C74750CC9D9F58: Thanks! These couldn’t have been easy to find. Now, to vaporize them in the chromatograph…
   [6DA] 0xBFFEF365F824FDCC: My data from your Geyser Rift plunge confirms traces of precious gems and ore. It must come from the Meteors forming them. You know what this means: time to catch some falling stars! Not literally, of course. Go and collect some Space Rocks for testing.
   [6DB] 0x44189864A283EF05: Find {1.Number} Space Rocks.
   [6DC] 0x565FEB64AD234323: Astro-Geologist
   [6DD] 0xA1B27CC424D9247F: Find some Space Rocks.
   [6DE] 0xB8DFF6F5E1EEF77B: By preventing Meteors from hitting the ground, the Defense Grid sure makes a Dystopian life safer! Visit the Observatory at any time to active it.
   [6DF] 0x162A066C0235FE21: Detailed analysis of those Space Rocks confirms: they’re loaded with valuable residue, but also dangerous radioactive isotopes. The Meteors are the genuinely harmful things in Dystopia. I’d like you to visit the Observatory and learn about the Meteor Defense Grid.
   [6E0] 0x3A5F3D5E546EF694: An Old Hope
   [6E1] 0x28E56B5E09CB1F20: Go to {OpTarget}.
   [6E2] 0x668821009F88ADF8: What a wonderful piece you bought! I’m not one for fashion myself.
   [6E3] 0x1CE681847B4A13EC: Hey! I’m pleased as punch you came by, but I’m busy with, uhh…something. That I don’t need help with. Just hang around town for a spell. Stop by the local shops and try on some futuristic fashions. And, uhh…keep your eyes open.
   [6E4] 0x5C620456F3632190: You already know your way around Oasis Landing? Great llamas! You really are an explorer!
   [6E5] 0x323F7195AFC8C5C3: Fashion Distraction
   [6E6] 0x8848EA8D2541921F: Buy something from a Clothing Pedestal.
   [6E7] 0xCDD6C8546A00FB1B: How’d you like the HoloVenture? I haven’t seen a HoloVenture in years!
   [6E8] 0xC966610246A4DD41: I didn’t expect you back so soon. I’m really busy trying to solve a complex temporal equation and should be done soon. In the meantime, why don’t you catch a HoloVenture at the Theater downtown? I hear the newest title is wonderful!
   [6E9] 0x19A4C38F59F7A234: Idle Amusement
   [6EA] 0x12E0D9270D1503C0: Go see a HoloVenture at the HoloVenture Theater.
   [6EB] 0xD2F5F2C2C99084F6: I hope you picked a good drink flavor! Did you notice any unusual Nanite activity over there?
   [6EC] 0x32255D8765A8F122: Ouch! Sorry, I just smacked the old gourd under the couch looking for…uhh, something. You look thirsty! Why don’t you a drink at the Cafeteria? I hear they’re so sugary and delicious that the place attracts Nanites from miles around!
   [6ED] 0x1AAD4D83673CFE7D: Empty Calories
   [6EE] 0x16799E01269279FD: Order a Synthesized Drink at the Cafeteria.
   [6EF] 0xD8D3A2998238F391: No trace of Skippy at City Hall? Drat. Where else have I been these past few days?
   [6F0] 0xDC1655F8674541FF: It’s time to come clean. My Nanite, Skippy, vanished days ago and I haven’t seen joint nor mandible of him since! I’ve had you retracing my steps. Could you please inspect the Lotto Records Archive at City Hall? Never mind why I was there!
   [6F1] 0x158EDF7DACF9E526: Honesty is the Best Policy
   [6F2] 0x9D626CF4B0657566: Check Lotto Records at the Oasis Landing City Hall.
   [6F3] 0x5960000CB573572C: Well, that’s one less place my dear Skippy might be. He can’t have left Oasis Landing!
   [6F4] 0xCF8D2D88999B5308: This problem is worse than I thought! I accidentally left a bit of important research data on Skippy’s hard drive. More than a bit: a few gigabytes, actually. He may have slipped out of my pocket during the Zero-G session. Go into the Zero-G chamber and find out!
   [6F5] 0xC3797176A522D5C7: Lost in Zero-G
   [6F6] 0xC7997C2117111E93: Experiment with Zero-G at the Observatory
   [6F7] 0x95888CD18FE180EF: Oh Skippy, where could you be? Well, I hope you enjoyed the grinding gears of Arena Competitions.
   [6F8] 0x9CE61A37A3B5A89D: Nanites, it’s been suggested, can establish hive minds with Bots of similar engineering. It’s possible Skippy made his way to the Bot Arena. He’d find friends there, and a wealth of power cells lying around. Head over and take in a competition, would you?
   [6F9] 0x1405E36C022737C8: Bugs of a Feather

   [6FC] 0x05E47FACF7875F8E: I’ve all but given up. He must just be drifting about Oasis Landing, lost and aimless. Oh, how I fear for little Skippy! It’s time for the brute force approach: get outside with a net and scoop up wild Nanites. I’ll know which is Skippy.
   [6FD] 0x8C295A64DB577283: Catch {1.Number} Nanites.

   [701] 0x1AB8613112C229AB: You found my beloved Skippy! Why don’t you hurry back and bring him back to me. I’ll give you a Holo Disc for your troubles. That way, you’ll always have a friend with you no matter where you end up!
   [702] 0x7988DFE2C9868E2A: Homeward Bound
   [703] 0x0D43F6EA9E0625FA: Talk to the Time Traveler.
   [704] 0xA081BDDFA598496B: Excellent! I’d take you for a colorful native myself. Now, get out there and explore!
   [705] 0xC1E1ACA8CD75E3F1: Now that you’ve joined me in this wild Utopian timeline, it’s time I taught you my research methods. The first step when visiting any alternate reality is blending in with the natives. Here is some Rainbow Dew I extracted from a Delightfully Oversized Flower. Use it on yourself!
   [706] 0xE4464EB71F48212D: If you don’t want my guidance while exploring this timeline, I’ll trust your instincts.
   [707] 0x362E89B9CF67DF84: The Scientific Method
   [708] 0xD86B9076C91A7A70: Use Rainbow Dew on yourself.
   [709] 0x6A16ECD40DE31FC8: Thanks! With your gracious assistance, we might be able to figure out the Dew’s origins.
   [70A] 0x01105BF2B99E789C: The Dew sample was biochemically fascinating! It’s a fine place to begin our investigation. We’ll need more samples from the local Delightfully Oversized Flowers. Any color will work. If a Delightfully Oversized Flower looks empty, you can sometimes get some Dew by shaking its base.
   [70B] 0xD700B07D322BA000: Don’t want to get your hands messy, eh? Well, Science isn’t for the faint of heart.
   [70C] 0x3FE7E4C01D7CD815: Collect {10.Number} Dews from Delightfully Oversized Flowers.

   [70F] 0xA970CFE466D6D2AD: Looks like you had a great time! Here’s hoping it didn’t come with a cost…
   [710] 0x01B2507F7FEFE203: In this Utopian timeline, Sims amuse themselves by hurling colorful Dew. Everyone winds up splattered and giggling like maniacs, but I wonder if the Dew carries any health risks? Go out in public and indulge in some Dewy delight. I’ll sample your plasma afterwards.
   [711] 0x5FBB0700D03D61FB: Don’t enjoy being a guinea pig? Well, I don’t blame you. They don’t like it either.
   [712] 0xB5B3D8C739DC1BF8: Throw Dew {1.Number} times at other Sims.

   [716] 0xC82931149901AC7E: Good news, everyone! Well, just you. I couldn’t find even a trace of toxicity in that Dew, so we’re perfectly safe researching this timeline. The next step in your Science-y journey is critter collection! Troll the local ponds for these “Rainbow Snails” I’ve heard about.
   [717] 0x80BABDB08B4B94F6: Explore Utopia by yourself, if you’d like. Some Sims must blaze their own paths.
   [718] 0x0A8D3390AB33B761: Pondering Rainbow Snails
   [719] 0xCCEBFDD4CA583CE1: Fish up some Rainbow Snails near floating flowers.
   [71A] 0xAFD7AC44B81D163F: They just got angry, eh? Well, that’s perfectly consistent with the data we’ve gathered so far.
   [71B] 0x7CDC3B4FB7E2F88D: Between Dew and Snails, we’ve covered Utopia’s ecology. But if putting Rainbow Dew in the atmosphere altered nature at the molecular level, how did it affect Sims? We’ll start with a simple emotional provocation. Accuse folks of Being too Rational and gauge their responses.
   [71C] 0x22424D61CDDEC7C1: I understand you don’t want to upset other Sims, but it’s only for a science experiment.
   [71D] 0x21E51496700A1CC6: Accuse {1.Number} Sims of Being too Rational.

   [720] 0x1D014D7C622067BC: Good gracious, it worked! Whimsy gets transmitted at a 100% signal rate regardless of your molecular makeup.
   [721] 0x2BB40361043A38F8: You’ve done wonderful work for me; it’s time to step up your inter-dimensional research. These folks Whimsy Waltz all day long, and it seems to be contagious! Embed yourself in the local population and see if Sims from your timeline can inspire the Whimsy Waltz organically.
   [722] 0x9AA08E179E97F054: Is this an issue of confidence? I’m sure your Whimsy Waltzes won’t get rejected too often.
   [723] 0x94C52C9D89EDD031: Inspire {1.Number} Sims to Whimsy Waltz.

   [727] 0x6DA20B81EE6794EF: Since we’ve found Utopian matter is both fundamentally different and wholly compatible with our own, try digging up a Rainbow Knoll. My instruments tell me they might contain valuable Simoleons! 
   [728] 0xB3F1592282DAC0BF: You really don’t want to take money just lying there? I suppose your integrity is commendable.
   [729] 0x34A665A82496A136: Simoleons for Science

   [72B] 0x179700CCE0A664F2: Magnificent! Thank goodness Oasis Landing keeps such meticulous records when it comes to atmospheric phenomena.
   [72C] 0xD02D53774FFFA0D6: I may have found a lead on the Wasteland’s Mysterious Door. The thing’s rumored to have fallen from the sky, and since it persists across dimensions we know it must have fallen before the timelines split. Scour the Stellar Observatory’s records for the answer.
   [72D] 0x2F1D8070E56772AE: Looks like you’re already familiar with the mysteries of the Wasteland. I’ll be around to help research the Wasteland if you need it!
   [72E] 0xF00AB65C7121E0E9: Buried in the Sand
   [72F] 0x0F4B9E35872A6ED9: Check the Observatory’s Records.
   [730] 0xA9096B84766A68C9: Thanks so much for digging out there! My back just isn’t up to it these days.
   [731] 0x1C67A4A97DB38887: According to the Observatory records you found, two objects fell into the drying sea that night: a large craft that became the Mysterious Door, and a smaller object that exploded in the atmosphere. Dig for any traces of it by excavating Wasteland Dig Sites.
   [732] 0x3106287488F5FE3E: Sweating for Science
   [733] 0xF0E94129E2D1E3EE: Excavate Dig Site heaps in the Wasteland.
   [734] 0x79BE3E9DD4C04624: I’m so pleased to see you feeling better! When you’ve rested, we’ve got pressing research to do.
   [735] 0x4C41AFDDC1072D70: Great woolly llamas, you look unwell! I’ve heard some terrible diseases lurk in the Wasteland, left behind once the ocean dried. Inter-dimensional pathogens are a specialty of mine, but this is a local virus. Go to the Hospital; they’ll clear it up right away!
   [736] 0x4AA4DA69361FAC3F: A Sickly Setback
   [737] 0x940CF208E4C8541B: Get treated at the Hospital.
   [738] 0x2424939880CB0873: My goodness, what a beauty! I can’t wait to get it near that Mysterious Door.
   [739] 0xECB7D3F46653AC89: While you recovered from that ghastly illness, I was hard at work on your excavated samples. That exploded meteor in the past may actually have been an artifact to unlock the door! Comb the Wasteland for fragments; you’ll know them when you see them.
   [73A] 0x31B52C86330F15AC: Assembling the Key
   [73B] 0xB81CAF743F7D7D88: Collect and assemble Wasteland Key Fragments.

   [73D] 0xF16FA4DB858D604A: Now that you’ve done the hard work to collect Key Fragments, it’s time for the fun part! Take the Assembled Key to the Mysterious Door. I’m not sure how to use it, but you’ve come a long way as an explorer. You’ll figure it out!
   [73E] 0x6236F67B7EAB6635: To the Waste, with Haste
   [73F] 0x693206726F8EE4C5: Insert the Assembled Key.
   [740] 0xC3FA3E5047F33E75: Great rampaging gnomes! The Ship sounds so wonderful! Tell me about absolutely everything you saw in there.
   [741] 0x26F74B3F2E24ADBB: You know what? As excited as I am to see what’s behind that door, in a craft from another world, I’ve decided to stay outside. You’ve done all the work to get us here and open this treasure trove; its contents should be yours alone.
   [742] 0x8D290892F8C60A9A: Cracking the Seal
   [743] 0xD6E65A51C3C166CA: Explore the Crashed Ship and report back to the Time Traveler.
   [744] 0xF31352CDBFA564F1: Great woolly llamas, you’re brilliant! My readouts show the Dystopia timeline has reverted to its original state!
   [745] 0x7503C12828AEF8DF: Since your fellow Sims’ collective belief in doomsday brought ruin about on its own, collective disbelief is the only thing that can undo Dystopia. Stopping the meteors isn’t enough; you must return to the community and convince them that the sky isn’t really falling.
   [746] 0x0D2336CBBC4A4F64: Convince {1.Number} Sims that The Sky isn’t Falling.
   [747] 0x40272BCBD8E9FB86: Reverse Psychology

   [749] 0xC6D845FC00F728A7: Thanks for attending the League of Concerned Doomsayers Meeting. I hope they had free coffee and donuts, at least.
   [74A] 0x37C306E5496C7145: That worked better than I thought! Not only did we change the Earth’s gravitational pull to attract meteors, but a group called the League of Concerned Doomsayers sprung up. It looks like you’re on the right track to changing the Future! Go to their meeting and see how serious they are!
   [74B] 0x147C32F398692FF9: Why wouldn’t you want to jump into a meeting of certified loonies? They have free coffee!
   [74C] 0xE63732EB087CAB80: The League of Concerned Doomsayers
   [74D] 0x54D20B774F078C8C: Attend a Doomsayers Meeting at City Hall.
   [74E] 0xE306CE54F33737D2: Great work! After you talked to the community, I’ve been hearing meteor talk on every street corner.
   [74F] 0x79963EC0EA4FBA36: Great wooly llamas! They really think the world will end? This is better than expected! I’m not sure whether there were enough people at the meeting to really start a movement. Go around town and spread the word that the Sky is Falling. Let’s get everyone thinking the end is near!
   [750] 0x5DB7C9E3E122BC4B: Convince {1.Number} Sims that The Sky is Falling.
   [751] 0x90BBBCE3FDC265C9: Fire in the Skies
   [752] 0x28074868A6D2C4B9: Successfully convinced {0.Number} of {1.Number} Sims that The Sky is Falling.
   [753] 0xF7BD3EF490F19555: You were so convincing that, for a moment, I thought you really did despise the environment!
   [754] 0x2305AFBA44C4351B: You’ve done it! The town is convinced the world really will end! It’s looking a little too clean around here. You should convince everyone to litter everywhere! If no one cares, I’m sure the Future will change for the worse! Successfully Joke about Trash Talking the Environment and let’s see how much garbage will pile up.
   [755] 0xE967621F77D8B2F0: Trash Talk the Environment to {1.Number} Sims.

   [759] 0x7D23B141923117F5: You want to change the Future for the worse? Let’s start by causing some destruction and mayhem! This old magnet I have should do the trick by attracting meteors to town. Take this Meteor Magnet and point it towards the sky to attract some meteors. It’s bound to garner some attention.
   [75A] 0x98B06A002BBF9C0E: Use the Meteor Magnet {1.Number} times outside.
   [75B] 0xAAF8BF003660A6D0: A Minor Indulgence
   [75C] 0xE4D4E0A804D8A6FC: Used Meteor Magnet {0.Number} out of {1.Number} times.
   [75D] 0xC56FE5EC012D14F6: Well, the Dew hasn’t melted you. I was slightly worried about that. How do you feel?
   [75E] 0xD3ED8C90E4B1A122: Great llamas! This data confirms that my goopy Dew has the potential to unleash the inner whimsical side of Sims! Happy Sims will lead to a happy Future, right? First we need a test subject… Since I need to operate the scanner, let’s choose…. You! Don’t be scared, it’s for science!
   [75F] 0x62706E86643E0E7D: Dewing a Trial Run
   [760] 0x1DA2BF178BEC89FD: Use Dew on yourself.
   [761] 0xC050BB7DA19D8B1B: Your Dewing spree created such emotional resonance that I detected it even in here!
   [762] 0x6B2E900BC5AD8D41: It works! Your readings were off the chart! Your quarks have acquired a distinctly whimsical spin, with only a small, colorful side effect! Just one Sim isn’t enough to make a difference – we need more! Take my whole stock of Dew and splash your fellow Sims with it.
   [763] 0x94A1F79273C621FA: Use Dew {1.Number} times on other Sims.
   [764] 0x6167E49256F8B234: Spreading Good Cheer
   [765] 0x1A09FA3D726F13C0: Use Dew on Sims {0.Number} out of {1.Number} times.
   [766] 0x4BD9F335ED0FE72C: It’s done! I can smell the joy descending on all Simkind. Here’s to peace and rainbow skies!
   [767] 0x71555C9218A40308: I’ve been keeping track of your progress and sadly, just splashing a few Sims won’t do it. In the meantime, I’ve modified my last goop of Dew into an aerosol spray form. This’ll pack enough punch to affect a whole region! Hand it off to the local Military Base and their pilots will seed the atmosphere. 
   [768] 0x0B3C9279A223E5C7: Planting Seeds of Joy
   [769] 0xCEC29D377C6B2E93: Visit the Military Base.
   [76A] 0x30FA96F81DB55F5C: Nothing makes me happier than a Scanner full of piping hot data. I’ll need further assistance soon.
   [76B] 0x4A54230C2A481318: You want to make the Future a better place? If my cheerful calculations are correct, we can use this goopy stuff I call Dew to make everyone happier! Take this scanner I cobbled together and gather some data of Sims laughing to confirm my calculations.
   [76C] 0x305218B44B98CA74: Altering the Future can have many unintended consequences. Let’s suspend our experiment on changing the Future.
   [76D] 0x8F4E4955816738D1: Scan {1.Number} Sims while they laugh.

   [771] 0xC4A2F7DA6A74F7EB: Our innocent, well-intentioned experiment has gone awry! Surprising how often that happens. The Future has become a filthy, polluted, meteor-scarred Dystopia! If we’re going to fix this, the meteors are priority one. Warn those “geniuses” at the Science Lab of the coming meteor-pocalypse.
   [772] 0x1BD5CD81F7FB52E3: You think Sims have benefitted by living in a dangerous world with falling meteors and stinky trash piles? Tough to argue with you there!

   [777] 0x219BB474F7328F62: So you wanted to keep the Utopian Future a world a harmony and bliss? I can agree with you – it’s a wonderful place!
