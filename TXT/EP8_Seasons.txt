   [064] 0xB88A665946B5E3F8: The renegade design of this table lamp playfully acknowledges your expectations, then shatters them.

   [068] 0xF061F2CB10C66FFB: We intended to explain how this table lamp was inspired by the petals of exotic flowers found along the shores of deep forest streams, but then we found out that the artist came up with this design right after eating one of those “fried onion” appetizers at a family restaurant.

Woe is the Sim who is burdened with this mischievous ornament, for the antics of the evil Mr. Gnome can be severely obnoxious. For example, he’ll unmake the bed right after you just made it. Seriously, who does that?!

You'll never catch me! Haunting your houses, tricking your treats... once I pick my victim you're mine for eternity!
   [072] 0xC3BCEAE46AC03245: This affable chap has a knackering for greens. As a young gnome growing up in an unfamiliar world, he would peer from the bushes as Sims challenged each other to scarf down handfuls of hot dogs, a vile meat that Bucktooth dare not consume. As the young lad came into his own, he introduced the tradition to his own people, yanking carrots from the ground and gnawing through them in record time! Now retired from his competitive years, he lives out his days as a rather ineffective scarecrow.
   [073] 0x4CE0D6FC19E66CDD: After careful consideration, this gnome is taking his talents to South Beach. Yeah, it's going to be real Hollywood down there - and that's just the way Brawn Brawn likes it. If you can't take the heat, get out of his season.
   [074] 0xE7EDD39176E0310D: Eyes black as a winter night, pale skin like a blizzard whiteout, and three lumps of coal affixed to his chest -- a staunch reminder of each of his bad years growing up in Strangetown.

   [075] 0x73F276461FDBAE0F: Last autumn, one of our top designers sat beneath a tree in a wide meadow and searched for inspiration. While she rested, she saw a single leaf removed from its branch and carried, looping and twirling on a light breeze, to the surface of a pond.

   [076] 0x497E3FEC1A73169D: Like every snowflake, no two Sims are exactly alike! Unless they're twins. Then they are. But if you're not a twin, contemplate your individuality while staring deeply into the Unique Snowflakes Mirror.

There’s no way we can avoid incineration, but at least with the Sun’s Bane Parasol we can delay it just one more day…
   [07C] 0xB142398F2FED88EF: The pie eating contest is another staple of community festivals everywhere. But wait -- anyone can eat a pie, right? Grab a knife and fork, and go to town – what’s the big deal? Well, here’s the trick: when people sign up for the pie eating contest, they don’t get a knife and fork!

   [083] 0xC6359FF0E913B74A: This happy little spirit seems perfectly content to hang out and haunt your pumpkin for you. Try to focus on how the ghost is a fun symbol of the holiday, and less on how it’s the trapped soul of an actual deceased person.

   [0BC] 0x1A8577559B035A6A: Crafted to fit in any living room and rated to hold small vases, plates, and books, the Boulder Built patio table is the ideal surface for any occasion. But, don't stand on it! It's Boulder Built, not Diamond Built!
   [0BD] 0xB3B7DD027CDE9FF6: Restore a little order to family meals with the Very Symmetrical Table. They won’t dare cause a ruckus in the presence of so many perfect right angles and rectangles. A support network of backup rectangles runs underneath the surface of the table for extra symmetry. The Very Symmetrical Table: you’ll start using a compass to lay out your silverware!
   [0BE] 0x398101C7FF433059: Originally created to cure dendrophobia, the Deep Forest Trees end table was designed to acclimate patients to the twisting branches of mature oak trees. The treatment didn't work, but these tables sure are pretty!
   [0BF] 0x94AE05110159A314: Do you love boats? Do you long for the sea? Do your crave melted butter? Then, the Crab Pot end table is for you! Made from pots from genuine crab boats, you'll have the smell of sea right in your living room.
   [0C0] 0x3928F451D5E1EE60: There are few straight lines in nature, and there aren’t more than necessary in the Rippled end table. Where straight lines would ordinarily go, we have allowed the edges to curve gently as with a spring breeze or rolling waves. Inspired by nature, made from all-natural materials.
   [0C1] 0x05FF650F045778B1: We can mark days on the calendar if we want, but there is no strict point of beginning or end for the seasons. One flows into the next, on and on, in a great circle. Consider the legs of the Seasons end table. Its curves do not stop at a predefined edge, rather they gradually cede their territory to one another. Your friends will love it. “Oh, I get it. Because of the nature of seasons!” they’re sure to say.
   [0C2] 0x950FED46A7BBEF2A: What do you see in the shapes of the Nature’s Flair end table? Tall blades of glass? Leaves in the wind? Rising flames? It can be any and all of these things. The Nature’s Flair was designed with the recurring patterns of nature in mind. Also nice to put lamps on.
   [0C3] 0xA62AF767EB98CBE2: Who says you can't improve on mother nature? Using old oak stumps, the artisans at Naturlone have handcrafted and precision-polished each of these works of art. These old trees have never looked better!
   [0C4] 0x88D2E1348DB47EBE: The Boardwalk Picnic Table is designed to withstand the most torrential rain and the heaviest snow. It can carry the heaviest paper plates and the heftiest plastic cups. Boardwalk Tables: If you can make it here, there'll be a seat waiting for you.
   [0C5] 0xFC567556D0971879: Here is another fine NeverMelt Icesplosion product. The surface of this table is so smooth it is nearly frictionless. The dramatic base is formed by setting off small, controlled explosions just below the surface of arctic pools. Each spout is flash frozen the second it forms and treated with NeverMelt. Yes, setting off explosions in freezing waters is actually someone’s job. He loves his work.
   [0C6] 0xB951495174CB07E4: Bombarding yourself with UV radiation for a quick, cosmetic tan is dangerous and barbaric. Get a quick, cosmetic tan the natural way by spraying your entire body with Golden Glow’s patented MuchoTan Bodycoat. Your skin will register at least a 97.5 on the Murakami-Grant Pigmentation Scale, and thanks to an infusion of our proprietary Saf-T Chemicals the impact on your health is minimal. The Golden Glow Tanning Booth. Your personality glows… shouldn’t you?
   [0C7] 0x63F9A6B50045CA07: Snowy the Snow Bear is a friendly-natured soul. With some cute earmuffs and a big red scarf and a nose made out of coal! (Bear does not magically come to life.)
   [0C8] 0x02D521DB08BF0212: This is a test bathroom blueprint
   [0C9] 0x9436F29DD43D7B9E: The smooth natural curves of the Naturlone trash can will bring the feel of the outdoors into your home! Dumping trash isn't very eco-friendly, but with the Naturlone, you'll kinda feel like you are!
   [0CA] 0x178E84E8175709DD: Don’t let the pouring rain soak your clothes, hair, and skin. You are not a stray cat! You are a human being, and therefore greater than anything nature can produce. Keep nature at bay with the Rain Disruptor, a collapsible shield that can be deployed in seconds to deflect those hated drops. And now that it’s waterproof, our Rain Disruptors are 700% more effective!
   [0CB] 0xEB67EA93D53DAF56: It’s the dream of any self-respecting mad scientist or supervillain: a machine that controls the weather. Now, their dream can be your reality! Whether you want to use it to destroy the world’s crops and cause a global economic collapse, or you just like making the weatherman look dumb, this Climatron Control Unit is the answer.
   [0CC] 0x73163EC96D93CCA2: Mystical forces that we can never hope to understand have gifted you with the magnificent Weather Stone. If you can find favor with this ancient totem, it will bestow upon you a fantastic gift. The exact nature of this gift depends upon who you are. You cannot hide your true self from The Weather Stone.
   [0CD] 0x3173005064497794: Of the many signs of spring, few are as pleasing to sight and smell as the bloom of wildflowers. Almost anywhere there is a free patch of ground, you can find these multicolored beauties reaching up toward the sun. There are many varieties. Can you collect them all?
   [0CE] 0x418CF325BEDF0C9C: This remarkable window allows so much natural light to cascade into your room, you’ll feel like you’re standing in the middle of an enchanted meadow as the sun comes fully over the horizon. Some will see the sun rising to its zenith in the window’s design, and others will see the full moon. Either is fine. Both day and night will look dazzling through this window’s panes.
   [0CF] 0x2F29E9A5B23CBC78: The world looks too beautiful through the Classic Arch to leave its windows shut all day. If the season’s right, then go ahead! Crack it open and feel the breeze whisper by. Each window uses our hidden hinge system to preserve the beautiful architecture of the frame. You’ll want one on every wall in the house! Purchase the Classic Arch window, and let the world in!
   [0D0] 0x76E16860D34EA86A: This frozen body of water is just big enough to skate on! Be sure to get out there and slide around. Miss this opportunity and you’ll have to wait another year!
