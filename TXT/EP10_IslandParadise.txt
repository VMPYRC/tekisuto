Perfect for the home or the “hospitality” industry.
   [0F0] 0x499B957189BB29CB: Looking to save your “resort” guests even more money? Buy a triple pack of these motel-quality window blinds and cover more wall area with a single installation. You’ll get three-for-the-price-of-more-than-one-but-maybe-not-so-much-as-you’d-think! What a bargain!!
   [0F1] 0xFA95CD763F70DB3F: For powerful, yet sleek window performance, try the TriPane Standard. It has all the power of three large panes of semi-smoked glass, but with none of the bells and whistles of conventional windows. Three is a powerful number.

   [4B3] 0x89DFD17F736BF64A: The sea urchin is a true delicacy of the sea… even though it resembles a not so friendly pincushion. It seems that the regular customers of {OpTarget} have been clamoring for more and more of this strange, yet tasty, treat.

   [4B8] 0x9D42B3ECACD21E15: It might look slimy, but eel tastes surprisingly similar to chicken. Maybe that's why the diners at {OpTarget} have been ordering so much of it! The chef would be very appreciative if {OpOwner} could catch some eel for the restaurant.

   [4C7] 0x864404B40C7CFF88: In an attempt to keep the ocean free of impurities, the scientists at {OpTarget} need to study some sand particles from the ocean floor. Since sand often collects inside seashells, they would like {OpOwner} to find some shells for them.

   [4FA] 0x798E26BD95D68B00: If your Sim is seasick, they will only start to feel better if they get to dry land or a docked houseboat. Vomiting will also do the trick.
