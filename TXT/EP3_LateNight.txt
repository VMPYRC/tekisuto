   [27F] 0x4A29F245A1AE92D0: Sometimes even the best location can fall out of favor. Remodeled cheaply many times, Crescent Bay Plaza is again under renovation which for now just means a lot of noise for its hapless residents.
   [280] 0x35A4FB4D54EA9C63: This historic building was once the meeting place of Bridgeport’s movers and shakers. However, lately it has fallen out of fashion and is now the denizen of citizens who do much less shaking and not too much moving either.
   [281] 0x0AF7EA06D3D4DD80: Built on stilts to take advantage of a steep property, this contemporary house features outstanding city views, twin bedrooms, and multiple view decks. You’ll hardly notice that traffic winds around 3 sides of the house.
   [282] 0xC575506C08D3F619: An efficient studio apartment is offered in the trendy floodgate section of town. Live here and be close to industry and the bustle of the upper bay.
   [283] 0x7A4F0C5AC001E8F1: The two story garage addition, with a mother in law apartment above, softened the effect of this hastily constructed house. However most locals still call it "Raised Eyebrows" because the façade resembles an ornery face.
   [284] 0x4BB20C742D4000C7: This château was built in the golden era of the Silver Screen when Bridgeport was the center of Film making. If this prohibition era mansion could talk, imagine the stories it could tell. Dual master suites and a speakeasy in the basement are among its many charms.
   [285] 0x3936998B5F357257: A modest house in the suburbs of Bridgeport can bring a Sim happiness. This one features an obstructed view from the upstairs bedroom of houses that have unobstructed views.
   [286] 0xEE47F96D9965131E: Long ago, a row of mansions lined downtown Bridgeport. The Landgraab Brownstone is now the only one to remain. Although the once opulent residence has been divided into income producing apartments, the historic garden and elegant façade are largely intact.
   [287] 0x85C55BA026D7D5E6: The distant skyline of Bridgeport beckons from this unimposing house. Being the first house on the block means you get home from work earlier than your neighbors!
   [288] 0x8A7909630470E19C: With a 180 degree unobstructed view of the Ocean, Cliff Cottage is the perfect house for entertaining on a grand scale or just getting away from it all.
   [289] 0x9ED11ACA1E428FA3: Return to this endearing home from your evening commute. The serenity of a bedroom community can be yours.
   [28A] 0xB1AC10C2F908B9C7: Owning the best house in a moderate neighborhood is generally considered a poor investment… Unless you are a politician who must live among his constituents.
   [28B] 0x1B9F44D1A5EADEA8: If you are searching for a five car garage with panoramic views, your search ends here. Perhaps built with more cash than class, the door bell goes “bling.”
   [28C] 0xAE9481302007CF44: Named when they had an ocean view, these apartments are moderately priced and convenient to downtown, the civic center and the stadium, but there are no ocean views.
   [28D] 0x9677F7285333262A: For some reason single male Sims seem especially attracted to this building. Perhaps it is the partially covered sports-car parking?
   [28E] 0xF38880559C3C1A78: Spared from demolition during the construction of the new stadium, Bridgeport Arms still boasts large apartments and partial views in a quiet neighborhood…except for when there is a game.
   [28F] 0xF43FFAC01BF9D4E4: This Egyptian Deco building is adjacent to downtown nightlife and boasts some odd shaped landscaping. Perhaps a Sim who has travelled to Egypt would have the answer?
   [290] 0x075C505A49958931: Just a bit too far out of the city to ever be really in style, Glenview manor caters to a reliable middle class city dweller who just can’t seem to give up and move to the suburbs.
   [291] 0x69C974E3FFE7DCE6: Built by the Zodiac Group to provide luxury housing to Bridgeport, One Leo Center is considered a premier location in the city.
   [292] 0xD3813D02D905CD02: Built at Founders Square, “the Keep” has one of the longest waiting lists of any building. This is surprising since it’s not that nice and its identical neighbor is not at all popular.
   [293] 0x7F62A12C43E19E5A: For an executive lodging to serve as a home away from home, this is the obvious choice for the discerning Tycoon. And like the nearby Civil Suites, the management asks few questions as long as you can pay.
   [294] 0x7536894870FBD226: City living with available outside space, the Veranda Villas features multiple balconies in most residences and an efficiency size penthouse.
   [295] 0x6340BA4866A1B581: Once the site of the Bridgeport armory, it was decided that next to a bridge was a poor place to store high explosives. Now the Armory caters to nocturnal city dwellers who like the thick walls and small windows.
   [296] 0x4A39D950E5885047: An agreeable tower close to downtown, Sims are often bizarrely confused about what subway stop to take to get to Powell house.
   [297] 0x90E773875A4C570F: Allegedly built on top of a spring from which all who drank of the waters would find true love, the Simerset has fallen into disrepair. Optimistic sims still come here searching for their hearts desire…and some still find it.
   [298] 0xE0EA40B687B39642: Built by the prosperous Maloney family, this once fashionable high rise has been eclipsed by newer more fashionable addresses. The Maloney’s themselves seem to have disappeared from society since suffering financial setbacks, but rumors persist of at least one still being a resident.
   [299] 0x55DF18A5BCE4E225: Once a fashionable resort for Sims seeking curative waters, Beachwood Springs now caters to mature Sims seeking moderately priced housing close to the hospital. Nevertheless, a caretaker remains in residence and dreams of the faded grandeur of the resort’s glory days.
   [29A] 0xFD42D1690A84D264: Formerly utilitarian working class housing, The Gentry long fell out of favor. Recently, however, it has become one of the trendiest addresses in Bridgeport and features a waiting list of residents.
   [29B] 0xBFD9026D549D5234: Built as the twin to its higher class neighbor, Founder’s Peace was quickly eclipsed by the gigantic bridge built right next to it. Its resident’s often wear earplugs to sleep.
   [29C] 0x2397ECA39DEEB5E1: Although it is newer and boasts better views, Two Leo Center is forever the runner up among Bridgeport’s best locations to live.
   [29D] 0xFB952E0F799A6B99: Open loft spaces for the artists in residence, Terpsichore studios offer live/work spaces to the creative Sim in a transitional neighborhood.
   [29E] 0x32526C5FA31DA235: Seafaring Sims formerly resided in the upper bay of Bridgeport and The Trawler lodge offered accommodations to those hearty souls when they were in port. We suspect this abode still offers housing to a motley crew.
   [29F] 0x8A46C1D5958928BB: Slated for demolition during bridge construction, The Off Ramp was spared by a last minute design change. Since all of the residents had vacated, this building is now especially young and hip.
   [2A0] 0x04B46770D0048E6C: The oldest luxury apartment building in town, an address in Breach House means money… old money. Once you have an apartment in Breach House you don’t give it up. They don’t even have a waiting list with anyone still alive on it!
   [2A1] 0xEBF49A53511839E8: Boasting some of the best views in the city, The Tidewater is popularly featured in almost all postcards from Bridgeport. Although the building is often quiet during the day, it seems to come alive at night.
   [2A2] 0x2901B853DA44F346: In a city that never sleeps, Sanguine Arms seems to come alive at night. Built next to the Goth Gazebo, there have always been rumors of odd happenings here, especially during a full moon.
   [2A3] 0x38FA2CAF9AF7A27E: Centrally located, the Glass Pillar building is a favorite among the fashionable and the trendy. It has some of the cleanest and seldom used kitchens in Bridgeport.
   [2A4] 0x5CE6699C279F6808: When offered a generous amount of Simoleons to sell, the former owner of this unimposing house that once featured excellent bay views and quiet serenity, simply refused. Undaunted, Bridgeport constructed the extension of the Bennett Highway and the resulting bridge nearly over its roof. It now features obstructed bay views and some traffic noise.
   [2A5] 0x6D1D8B9A576ACEF2: Commanding vistas of both the ocean and the city highlight this historically important home. Faced with an excellent property, the architect opted to ignore the city views, placing relatively few windows, thereby forcing the focus of this house to the wide expanse of the ocean.
   [2A6] 0x4BBB6F70A71A87AD: This sparse, modern home with stunning views and a huge pool is perfect for one person. However, it must be one person who likes to live very well and host fabulous parties.
   [2A7] 0xE61927254866973C: Built with a family in mind, this elegant modern home matches modern architecture with contemporary living. An easy floor plan, dual master baths, and a large recreation room all add to the appeal of this view home.
   [2A8] 0x64AFAF7E0DE7A3B9: Modern form and function highlight this understated home which features a large cantilevered wing. Its modest, simple lines keep this large house from looking too imposing, but those with good taste know that still waters run deep.
   [2A9] 0xAC9332FD63C600FC: Choose the buttercup model house as an excellent starter investment. Close to schools and a short commute to downtown make this suburban house a good choice. You can barely see the graveyard.

   [6E6] 0xF36F610372CB9561: Oh no! {OpOwner} didn't show up, so the re-enactment was a total mess. Troops were falling all over the place and weren't at all in their formations. The audience was totally bummed that event was such a failure.

   [6F8] 0xF6A9B3EF97AE0112: What a tragedy! Beatniks were forced to snap their own fingers during the poetry reading, leading to many blisters. The only benefit to {OpOwner}'s failure to perform is that bandage sales are up.

   [7FE] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E4: Ooo… Buuuubbles! Your Sims will love the Hot Tub as much as you do. Warning: Extended use may lead to pruning.
   [7FF] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E5: Shy Sims are happiest in the company of close friends and don’t take well to strangers.
   [800] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E6: If all the Sims ever created joined hands in a chain, they would stretch from Sunset Valley to Bridgeport and back over one billion times!
   [801] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E7: Keep an eye out in Bridgeport for the food truck. It’s the best place to get a sinfully greasy snack on the go!
   [802] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E0: Feeding Digital Fish isn’t necessary, but it helps Sims feel like they’re making a difference.
   [803] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E1: Wanna mix things up? Consider renaming your band to something silly.
   [804] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E2: Gigs are a great way to gain money and fame, provided that your Sims show up.
   [805] 0x6CD6428210DEA9E3: Tired of giving the same performance with the band? More skilled Sims should consider doing a Sweet Move to freshen things up.
   [806] 0x6CD6428210DEA9EC: Up to four Sims can join a band. If one gets on your nerves, kick them out!
   [807] 0x6CD6428210DEA9ED: Is your Sim in a band? Many band interactions are found on instruments, your Sim, or their bandmates.
   [808] 0x3D220B6AD18BFCDF: Black lights – they aren’t just for raves anymore! Try modifying one of your lamps at home to keep the party going all night long.
   [809] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDD: Once your Sim gains a skill point for any instrument, consider asking another Sim to Form a Band!
   [80A] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDC: Serenading other Sims is a great way for skilled musicians to create that certain mood. Why not give it a try?
   [80B] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDF: Feel like making music with other Sims? Consider jamming. It’s a nice way to make friends too.
   [80C] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDE: The key to making your Sim famous is befriending Celebrities. Send them to the hottest spots in town to make some Celebrity connections!

   [80E] 0x6CD6458210DEAED8: Celebrity Sims are under greater public scrutiny, so watch your Sim’s actions! They might end up the talk of the town…and not in a good way.
   [80F] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDB: Celebrities won’t talk to just anyone. Impress Celebrities by talking to them about subjects they are interested in and maybe they’ll warm up to your Sim.
   [810] 0x6CD6458210DEAEDA: Need some personal info about local Celebrities? Try to pick up some dirt by asking other Sims for Celebrity Gossip.
   [811] 0x6CD6458210DEAED5: Celebrities keep tall gates around their homes to prevent curious fans from visiting them. Your Sims will have to befriend Celebrities around town before being allowed to visit their homes.
   [812] 0x6CD6458210DEAED4: Daring denizens of the night may be roaming your town. Will you fight against them or join them?
   [813] 0x3D220B6AD18BFCDE: Want a wall stereo of your very own? Perhaps you can snag one when nobody is looking…
   [814] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0A: Vampires can...breed? That’s one cute baby, except for the fangs!
   [815] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0B: Vampires are at their best at night – they gain skills more quickly, their motives decay slower, and they can read other Sims' minds to learn their traits, likes, and dislikes!
   [816] 0x6CD6448210DEAD08: Vegetarian Vampires can enjoy a special snack: Plasma Fruit! Cultivate it like any other fruit with seeds found around town.
   [817] 0x6CD6448210DEAD09: Vampires enjoy special benefits during the night, but watch out during the day. Too much sun and they’ll be paying the price.
   [818] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0E: Enjoy a modern style? Consider building platforms in your Sim’s home. They’re a great way to define space in open floor plans.
   [819] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0F: If your Sim exclaims loudly about how dead a venue is, try to find a Hotspot and get to where the action is!
   [81A] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0C: Looking for some rough or lowbrow fun? Try a Dive Bar. Want to dance the night away? Head to a Dance Club! Want to schmooze with high class Celebrities and rich Sims? Try a Lounge.
   [81B] 0x6CD6448210DEAD0D: Be sure to check out the Dance Clubs. With a little practice, your Sim will be sporting some hot new moves.

   [81D] 0x6CD6448210DEAD03: Be sure to check the daily newspaper or gossip with Sims to discover all the Hotspots on any given night. Hotspots are happening places where all the Sims will be!

   [81F] 0x6CD63F8210DEA48B: Making high Quality drinks requires a lot of practice. Your Sim will need to try making each type of Drink several times before they’ve truly mastered making it.
   [820] 0x6CD63F8210DEA48A: Having high skill, great mood, and a good list of custom drinks helps Sims make money while moonlighting at Bars.
   [821] 0x6CD63F8210DEA489: Mixologists can learn to make custom drinks at the Bars around town by sampling them a few times.
   [822] 0x6CD63F8210DEA488: Is a wall too much privacy but no wall isn’t enough privacy? Build a half-wall for just enough privacy!
