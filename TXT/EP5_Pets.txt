   [332] 0xE533AA4C61CB6AA0: Set somewhat apart from its neighbors, this once elegant Victorian graces the river's edge with a haunting reminder of days gone by. If you plan to restore this home, beware of feline vengeance - and musk!
   [333] 0xACB293BBB1A14CB5: An open floor plan and a large fenced in yard make this house a veritable pooch palace. No misbehaving will be tolerated though so one wonders - should you beware of the dog, or should the dog beware of the owner?
   [334] 0xA01A7769E924A0AD: Built from locally sourced materials to reflect a contemporary aesthetic, this sturdy house invites comments at the same time as its monolithic façade discourages uninvited guests. Heavy fieldstone walls keep the world, and any snooping paparazzi, at bay.
   [335] 0x2502E338409614E8: An open floor plan and a generous number of bedrooms make this newer ranch home a good choice for a larger family, or potentially a group of friends. Entertaining in this house is made easier with its large deck and light filled sunroom.
   [336] 0x795575710247EC76: Homesteaded many years ago by the ancestor of the current residents, this was once the finest house in town. Of course it was also the only house in town. Downsides include a somewhat distressed building, and the land it sits on is significantly diminished in acreage from its original size. However, if you can resist political pressure to rezone for commercial construction, and you don't mind the bustling downtown noise, you'll have quite the hot property for quick access to everything the town has to offer.
   [337] 0x4487D152358E0375: Modestly priced but full of charm, this small Victorian house is just waiting to be shown some love. It's a simple starter home, but close to town and full of untapped potential.
   [338] 0x40FD6E6B8532888A: Dwarfed by the grandeur of the landscape around it, this modest but proud ranch sits quietly on the powerful river's edge. Living here and working the land might be difficult for some, but with dedication comes reward.
   [339] 0x1F3C4A626EB70325: An old fashioned farmhouse lovingly restored is the perfect place for a young couple hoping to build the foundations of a large family. In the meantime, the sizable barn and substantial yard can support a veritable menagerie of pets.
   [33A] 0x737F8C8C2F746688: This large dwelling has a loft living room/bedroom, two patio areas for barbecue parties, and a large lap pool for those looking to stay fit. Main areas are all hardwood floors and furnishings have a modern flair. Owners can even enjoy sitting by the fire outside in the evenings.
   [33B] 0x1A7A9D660CB8EFA2: A modest house in a forgotten corner of a nice neighborhood could be a diamond in the rough for the right investor. Why not take a chance on this one?
   [33C] 0xBD24BB261B3141AA: Constructed of high grade wood and local stonework, this three bedroom house includes a spacious den overlooking the meticulously landscaped front yard. Perfect for any family, the dining room will accommodate large dinner parties with ease - and flair. A separate car port is sure to keep your vehicle secure.
   [33D] 0xCFF8BD33869E5808: A very spacious five bedroom home complete with fireplace in the living room, a den, dining room with access to a large deck, and separate en suite bedroom upstairs for the master of the house. Great for a large family or even someone with lots of pets. The property also features a large backyard bordering into the hills.
   [33E] 0x9F9FD7F1BB01F21F: This modern two bedroom home includes a barn for potential horse owners, a beautiful stone fireplace, Mission style kitchen cabinetry, and a spacious dining room. It’s the perfect house for any new homeowner. Glass façades enhance the feeling of an open floor plan. A lap pool with spacious stone deck make evening barbecue parties a great event.
   [33F] 0x49758E101A9270B3: Large rooms make this house exceptionally spacious for a one bedroom home, and the bathroom is equally roomy. Someone would have to accumulate quite a lot to make this place look cluttered - hoarders forewarned.
   [340] 0xF6D4DD786246CAC5: More spacious than expected for a one bedroom home, this house is caught mid-renovation. Although currently boasting an updated kitchen and a large new deck, the bathroom is charitably described as "charmingly original" and the landscape remains "full of potential".
   [341] 0xFBD7DF79FE29422F: For the decadent gardener, this home has a large atrium within the house and a roomy greenhouse in the backyard. Hardwood floors throughout, and a Ranch Style kitchen add to its unique flair. The interior is spacious enough to include two living room areas, one casual and the other for formal occasions.
   [342] 0x7A99B3A557EFC34A: This beautiful modern home with an amazing view features a gourmet kitchen and a workout room adjacent to the bedroom. One supposes this room might just make a good nursery instead, should you be so inclined.
   [343] 0xC1E563A558086366: A quiet sedate house in a newer subdivision keeps its focus inward. You probably won't even have to meet your neighbors if you live in this starter home.
   [344] 0x9EA52930DE9953CD: Thoroughly for thoroughbreds, this well-appointed farm house might be the best place to breed horses in the local township. It features a large stable and hay loft, plus a comfortable and elegant house with a solarium and wraparound porch.
   [345] 0xEAAC0111403D8F1E: Elegant gardens and shabby chic décor through most of this house make it a gem of a find. However, things are rarely as innocent as they appear.
   [346] 0x4469DA664B3C0E69: Simple and mostly sturdy, this home is the ideal first house for those who are a little bit country. No doubt the pleasant occasional drum of rain on the roof will make up for the minor flooding due to the lack of a foundation.
   [347] 0xDFABF5F8EF18E837: When you really want to leave the city behind, this suburban style house will make you think there must be shopping malls and fast food chains nearby... it's just a bit too out in the country for that though.
   [348] 0x54E40834EEAABB97: This deluxe home is great for any large family of Sims - or pets! The outdoorsy type will love the homey barn for horses and the large back deck for hosting parties. Notable features include an elegant full size dining room complete with marble tiled fireplace, not to mention the built in library. A kitchen with island counters makes the perfect space for serving a quick cozy meal.
   [349] 0x5A21EF050E4B0212: This fine starter home has a spacious living room, adjoining work area suitable for a desk, and full size bedroom. It is surrounded by beautiful Hydrangea bushes that add a lush feel to the location. Its close vicinity to the equestrian center is an added perk for any aspiring rider.
   [34A] 0x5B9410AAB20EC8A0: An ornate Victorian house on the edge of town exudes feminine charm. Strangely it is often the local male residents that find this home irresistible.
   [34B] 0x24A173F798DD5A22: This house features a horse arena and accompanying barn for the prosperous horse owner. It has a spacious living room and two separate bedrooms each with en suite bathrooms. Perfect for two roommates or a couple with children. One bedroom even has a built in fireplace to stoke the romance in your life.
   [34C] 0x610DE4B8C7264329: Rustic country living, but with all the modern conveniences can be found in this well appointed ranch. A three car (or truck) garage, custom built pool, horse barn, and a basement media room are among the features of this gentleman's country estate.
   [34D] 0xD7B5CEDB14D3DF4B: This generously sized house for a growing family includes a large deck, pool, and solarium - all the while presenting a modest face to the street.
   [34E] 0xD98B37355BD0301D: Cozy and compact is the perfect way to describe this newer home that is ready to go. A garage, paired with large decks and large windows, means this house is just waiting for the right occupant and their pets, be they beast or fowl.
   [34F] 0xB83AACACCB007627: Named for the constant chirping heard from its feathered residents, this flea market decorated home exudes charm. Will it allow its residents to spread their wings or keep them in a gilded cage?
   [350] 0xA6D82872331079D7: A charming house in an idyllic setting, features its own spring fed pond and a relaxing shady porch, yet still an air of gloom seems to persist.

   [3A4] 0x0EA6FD1D285461B8: The Bedlingtons are just the sort of new money the residents of Appaloosa Plains frown upon, having come to live in the country with no real respect for the land. Bertram is rarely seen out of his tweed button down vest, with Buckley close at his heels. Along with his wife Patricia, they love the beautiful outdoor vistas found along the river's edge, but as they enter the twilight of their lives they care little for any manner of preservation. Were their eyesight better they may notice the angry glares of neighbors as they zip down the driveway in their gas guzzler, even if it's doubtful they'd give someone else's considerations a second thought.
   [3A5] 0x59A23481095B39D7: The Bird sisters always seem to be above the daily squabbles of the other townsfolk. Slightly aloof and ever mysterious, their charm and porcelain doll appearance earns them many eager suitors. Oriole's fascination with other's knick-knacks has landed her in trouble on numerous occasions, but Alouette's work at the local paper generally keeps the family's name clean. Can this odd couple continue their troublesome ways or will their luck eventually run out?
   [3A6] 0xDDB3D8089DEBCEB2: If you ask Vera Blackburn about dog obedience she'll bluntly tell you, "There's no such thing as a bad dog, merely a bad owner." It's hard to argue with her approach when you find yourself cut off mid-sentence with a snap of her fingers and a fire in her eyes. The years haven't been kind to her complexion - some say the wrinkles were sealed in place from her harsh demeanor and ever present frown. Those who get to know her though will discover the love she has for her canine companions, and may pick up some useful tricks to use on their own pets along the way.
   [3A7] 0xE2DC00FA7C85BB61: Vallari is living the good life, unfettered by the rigors of such things as "responsibility", "basic decency", and "fiscal responsibility" - all those topics her mom used to nag her about. Well her mom isn't around now, and she's free to seek thrills and pursue hot fads as she blows through the family fortune. She thinks of her day job at the spa as simply a means to meet a wealthy and handsome client - preferably single.
   [3A8] 0xFCD9E6BBC3223F4C: "Dangnabbit, NO this land is not for sale!" - These are the first and last words any politician or businessman will hear when they pay Tate Curley a visit. As a descendant of one of the oldest settlers in town, Tate finds himself sitting on a prime piece of real estate right along Main Street. As outside pressure increased, Tate and Esme became introverted and guarded, building walls to keep unwanted visitors out. If someone could only find a way to break through their gruff exterior, a veritable encyclopedia of the town's history and stories of the old west await.
   [3A9] 0x1801E67CA2982C72: As a fresh face in the Midwest, Honey is discovering a whole new meaning to country singing! This talented songbird hit a rut in writing her new album and thought some new scenery would break the block. Southern gentlemen and southern charm have inspired writers for generations, but life in Appaloosa Plains has taken on a style all its own. With things so good, will she become the town’s newest permanent resident?
   [3AA] 0x5FC0DD745D5BEC00: Barrington and Juanita fell madly in love in a whirlwind romance that swept through the town of Appaloosa like a twister speeding across the plains. Juanita was visiting home after her big win on the reality cooking competition Dishes to Delicacy, a show that takes minimum wage dishwashers and turns them into master chefs. She immediately caught the eye of Barrington, the high school coach turned administrator of Appaloosa's new world class stadium. These two rags to riches stories simply clicked, and with the expected pitter patter of tiny feet, it can't be too long before wedding bells chime throughout the town!
   [3AB] 0x9BAF5DB0C1200629: As great descendants of the indigenous occupants of Appaloosa, the Fox family respects the land - and their privacy. Having reclaimed a large plot of land down in the flood plain, they prosper from the fertile soil that has built up over multiple generations. Now they run the most prosperous ranch in town and take great pride in their hand built home. They're certainly self-sufficient, but it wouldn't hurt them to broaden their social circle either.
   [3AC] 0x4B3631BB656BD96E: This eclectic group has decided to pool money together to rent their own home on the range. They come from all walks of life... Benni is the southern belle with modern flair. Zac is the local bad boy - line cook by day and biker by night. Hailey is the typical girl next door who wants nothing more than a pup to call her own. Kenji is the junior archeologist who can't wait to get a closer look at the dinosaur dig on the edge of town. The one thing they all share is a love of animals, but the landlord has a very firm policy of no fur allowed. Until they can change his mind, it looks like they're stuck with a feathered friend.
   [3AD] 0x20CE916782728653: Chuck Hobble has had enough of scrambling to book gigs and spending every night in a different dusty motel room. Bumps, lumps, thrills and spills have all contributed to the aches in his bones. Nobody said the life of a rodeo cowboy would be easy, but settling down as a minor celebrity in a town like Appaloosa has its perks. He moved in with his long time friend Johnny, a country songwriter who shares the pains of losing a family due to a life on the road. When they aren't busy swapping stories of groupies, they tend to their horses in their now peaceful existence.
   [3AE] 0x1509B0E5473B0C8A: The townsfolk give Ms. Lionheart a wide birth should they see her approaching. Not that there's a problem with her that anyone can pinpoint per se, but she is a little... shall we say... eccentric. With her colorful leopard print hat and garish feline apron, the local teens have dubbed her "Old Kitty", a name she'd no doubt give them a good drubbing for should it ever be said to her face. As the last remaining member of her family, she lives out her days with her four cats, and that's just the way she likes things.
   [3AF] 0xB65CCF01AD7BC719: Gracie is a free spirit, but she reigns it in for her day job. Don't be mistaken, she loves working with the kids at Crestview School and takes satisfaction from the opportunity to help shape their lives. But is there more to Graci than meets the eye? When she's not busy grading papers she dreams of a glamourous life in modeling and finding the right man to sweep her off her feet.
   [3B0] 0xAE29537DD983AAB2: The Marshalls are madly in love, have a beautiful home, and successful careers. What could go wrong? A glossy exterior hides their secret pain - try as they might they've been unable to have a child. Crib, toy box, and highchair sit unused, and so the Marshall's bide their time and mask their emotions by adopting all the pets they can handle. Puppies, kittens, foals - anything they can nurse and cherish, they welcome into their home. Will they one day be able to have the final addition that would make their family complete?
   [3B1] 0xEA1235183314C430: Sofia felt trapped for years - trapped in a loveless marriage, and trapped in the concrete jungle of the city. She made the decision to take back her life by kicking her husband to the curb, and uprooting her moody teenage son for a fresh start in the country. Flush with cash from the divorce, she purchased a horse to help charm the posh country crowd. Now that she's a cougar on the prowl, will young Cruz be able to adjust to his new family and make friends in a brand new town?
   [3B2] 0xF4595F65048EF991: The Millers are one of the most well-liked families in all of Appaloosa. They've built a reputation as trustworthy humanitarians with their strong family values and unending generosity. As fate would have it, they live right next door to the Riffins - certainly a bunch that could use a helping hand. As Quincy and Jacquie keep a watchful eye over their young neighbors, will the seemingly innocent Maisy take her own special interest in Calvin Riffin?
   [3B3] 0xEDE38796AF3CFF14: Having moved to the mainland from Hawaii a few years back, the Parrott family seems like an exotic bunch to the country locals. Their troubles are effectively masked by their neighbors believing their mannerisms stem from cultural differences. Kanoa leads a busy life, routinely commuting to the city on business - and perhaps more. Jazlyn however appears to have become meek and downtrodden over the years; can she find the strength to take back her life and come into her own?
   [3B4] 0x6A8525FA60EB0CA2: Imogen had it all - as a young beauty pageant star she was at home on the stage! The world grew up with her year after teenage year on the hit show, "As the PlumBob Turns". And she blossomed into adulthood with a breakout role in "Simsylvania", playing the love interest between two clans of werewolves, oceans apart in Transylvania and Pennsylvania. Alas, her world came crashing down around her as an unexpected pregnancy led to some unfortunately botched plastic surgery. As the heiress to the silver screen, she's remaining incognito in the countryside until all her problems blow over.
   [3B5] 0x56E33E1479E70F78: Gavin Pinkerton is slowly adjusting to life in the country. As a long time plastic surgeon to the stars, business was booming in the glamorous city of Bridgeport. One small slip of the scalpel and a medical malpractice lawsuit later though, Gavin found himself desperate for a change of scenery. Being the town doctor in Appaloosa isn't quite the fast paced high pressure life he was used to, but perhaps the countryside has other charms to offer. For the time being though, he plans to lay low and hope his tarnished reputation doesn't catch up to him.
   [3B6] 0xB06AA6569118383A: The Riffin family - what's left of them that is - has suffered through extraordinary hardship. Clement and Clarissa were loving parents, living off the sweat of their brow and working the land until an unfortunate farming accident left the children orphaned at a young age. As the oldest, Calvin quickly shouldered the responsibility of holding the family together. With their parents watching over them from beyond, and some helping hands from the townsfolk, the Riffins endure and move on.
   [3B7] 0x353A09AF69B95290: Benjamin - handyman by day, eligible bachelor by night. He lives alone with his pup Ralston, but by no means is he lonely. The women of Appaloosa appreciate his skills and there's nothing subtle about the number of house calls he makes for "broken" appliances. Will he ever find a reason to settle down?
   [3B8] 0x3A023A8A2241DCE1: The Singleton brothers are self-made millionaires, striking it rich by cashing in on the tech sector just before the dot com bubble burst. With lots of money and lots of free time, they decided to head west — Midwest that is. They haven't exactly had a lot of success raising horses (but what city slicker does?), but they figure if they keep throwing enough money at it something will eventually click. Between Rodney’s book smarts and Booker’s charming looks, they’re ultimately bound for success in anything they take on.

   [3C0] 0x8EB230EFC808640D: Alouette
   [3C1] 0xCB8547706597FE02: Alouette is the older Bird sister. She uses her influence as a journalist to protect her younger sister's image. A positive story in the paper does wonders to fix a damaged reputation!

   [3C8] 0x2DC8CEDE6B4A79E0: BaBa
   [3C9] 0xD1ECBA4B120E2798: This little puppy is a terrible terror! The constant yapping, digging, and slobbering EVERYWHERE is enough to drive anyone up a wall! Luckily he found a home with the Marshalls, a couple with more than enough love to lavish on this needy pup.
   [3CA] 0x6399A7A35572263F: Babycakes
   [3CB] 0x86532A9220C0A046: Babycakes is one pampered kitty. She has the best of everything in life, as Gracie literally babies her. Friendly and well behaved, you'd be hard pressed to find a better companion. Her one quirk is her preference to stick to the first floor. The red lights of Gracie's bedroom aren't very soothing, and the thumping coming from the room makes her dive for cover under the furniture!
   [3CC] 0x16AD71F04F8946FD: Bacon
   [3CD] 0x07C1A293335545DC: Barrington
   [3CE] 0x0CC71B78369AC7AE: This high school coach turned sports administrator is livin' large in life. When the county approved funds for a world class indoor sports facility, he suddenly found himself in charge of a lot more than a rag-tag group of country kids. It's not just his career that's on the rise, because coming home to Juanita each night is any jock's dream. Can Barrington keep playing this hot hand, or will success catch up to him?
   [3CF] 0x70D37AC6D6767C04: Bea
   [3D0] 0x2DD5A6DE6B54BF80: BeBe

   [3D4] 0x8B0027006244D914: Benjamin
   [3D5] 0x879DF69A5FB077CE: As the town's handyman, Ben leads an honest hard-working life. Equipped with a quick smile and a loaded tool belt, the women in town aren't exactly upset when something around the house breaks down. In fact - appliances in Appaloosa seem to have a mysteriously high defect rate!
   [3D6] 0x36D836F0610DEC84: Benni
   [3D7] 0xD4FCC00AA77D1C4C: Benni is a southern transplant, coming to the town of Appaloosa Plains to make new friends and discover new opportunities. This little flirt won't have any trouble attracting attention, but how long will her roommates tolerate it?
   [3D8] 0xC559100F5B500B5B: Bertram
   [3D9] 0x725E7E9867A5B4FF: Curt and proper, Bertram gets on in the community by ignoring those he chooses to disassociate himself with. In his mind, success in life bestows the privilege of dictating one’s retirement, and he plans to live out his days in whatever manner suits his current whims. He loves the peace of the countryside without realizing or caring that his glib attitude is contributing to the local’s distrust of new faces moving into town.
   [3DA] 0x2DE3AEDE6B610ABD: Bird
   [3DB] 0x406B5791D88031EA: Blackburn

   [3DE] 0x2DEACCDE6B675CF5: Bolt
   [3DF] 0x510BF9AA83BB40C6: Booker
   [3E0] 0x8712539DEC70D89D: Rodney got the brains, but Booker got the body. At a young age he learned to use his good looks to get his way, and those same skills served him well in the world of business. As the front man for the Singleton's projects, he excelled at raking in venture capital funds. After their big payoff, he's free to spend his days pretending he knows how to run a ranch.
   [3E1] 0x793FE62A841F0CD9: Bramble
   [3E2] 0x6814E1C3336B4B6E: Bramble is one rugged horse. He's certainly loved by the Fox's, but nobody that would call him a pet. This working animal knows his role around the ranch and dutifully performs his job day in and day out.
   [3E3] 0x3AB0CF492C9167F0: Breaker
   [3E4] 0x29424CC25FFB4EB5: Breezy

   [3E7] 0xD5D8256AA2E8C9F9: Buckley
   [3E8] 0xBC07C45D7C3FEFB9: Imported from a renound breeder across the pond, Buckley is everything a sophisticated gentleman's dog should be. Loyal and proud, he puffs his chest out and waits patiently to be fed only the finest in gourmet foods. His keen nose makes him the most skilled hunter in all of Appaloosa.
   [3E9] 0x58517A83711DA5FC: Bullock
   [3EA] 0xDBB0D2FD7B707830: Button
   [3EB] 0x6A291BB15FB5B76F: Calvin
   [3EC] 0xE486654F26472E59: Calvin is a young adult, but there's no doubt he's mature beyond his age. He wasn't always this way, but responsibility was forced on him as a teen when he became the head of the family following his parents farming accident. Now that it's fallen on him to guide Cornell and Chantrelle through life, he's learning all sorts of new skills he never knew he had.
   [3ED] 0xD9B46AE142491232: Stray Cat

   [3F1] 0x4538EA00B01B5FE7: Chandra
   [3F2] 0xA18F68862593522C: Chantrelle
   [3F3] 0x2655ACC6441725C4: Chantrelle was just a toddler when she lost her parents, shielding her from the worst memories of that unfortunate accident. She's old enough now though to realize that her family is pretty different from the other kids at school. Will she find a way to grow into a well adjusted teen, or will the past continue to haunt her?
   [3F4] 0x951AF15FCED20A88: Charmaine
   [3F5] 0x6FD3AAFC73E63A96: Chase
   [3F6] 0x0ADE9FD46F560321: Cheyenne
   [3F7] 0x29A6201091381A16: Cheyenne is a no nonsense woman, but that's not to say she doesn't get along well with others. After spending much of her life on the edge of town, she discovered the pleasure of going down to main street to mingle. Eventually it dawned on her that a seat in local politics was just the right fit, enabling her to protect the town's history from the recent influx of city slickers.
   [3F8] 0x6FFCC2FC740968A4: Chuck
   [3F9] 0xB64BC9A072228AE0: Yee-haw! An old regular on the rodeo circuit, Chuck has lots of tall stories to tell to anyone who cares to listen. After so many years on the road, he's happy to move in with his friend Johnny for a long deserved break. His body is feeling pretty busted and broken these days, but never say never when it comes to a return to competition.
   [3FA] 0x920AB6485258283C: Clarissa

   [3FE] 0x07002B114BDD942B: Cornell
   [3FF] 0x6EC50D403F352C0D: Little Cornell is getting used to life without a watchful parent's eyes on him. As his older brother Calvin struggles to keep up, young Cornell has turned into a bit of a troublemaker. Taking risks, accepting dares... how long can he keep going before something goes very wrong?
   [400] 0x38CBD8DE723196AA: Cruz
   [401] 0x4BB36B819AA9EB10: Cruz was perfectly happy living in Bridgeport. He had his friends, his hobbies... he'd even successfully blocked out his parents frequent fighting. Ever since his mom kicked his dad to the curb though, his life has been turned upside down. Dragged out to the country, he's being forced to fit in with a crowd that totally isn't his scene, in a time of life when you really don't want to stand out. Worse yet, he has to deal with his mom bringing new men home constantly. What's a troubled teen to do?
   [402] 0xC440DD09FCDB80A8: Curley
   [403] 0xBBAB5F822B06E6D2: Dakota
   [404] 0x447393779B3F8171: Even as a toddler, young Dakota is already a natural with animals of all types. He's being raised with the same respect for the land and life his ancestors held in such high regard. 
   [405] 0xE6F44B824389A329: Dancer

   [40B] 0xFB9DCEDE4F62AAC7: Ditz
   [40C] 0x92C94D37E3A518F1: This old mutt may just be the fabric that truly holds the Riffin family together through their troubled times. She's not always fully aware of her surroundings, and loud noises will send her running for cover, but her timid vulnerability gives the Riffin children something to love.
   [40D] 0xEFA142C0E47EFEB2: Dizzy

   [414] 0xC1F187DA79A73487: Ellada
   [415] 0xC20CAEDA79BE3E97: Elliot
   [416] 0x4046127FE10BD627: Wild Horse
   [417] 0x02A1FADE52E4CC62: Esme
   [418] 0xDD5C100A7190D514: Esme is Tate's doting wife, having been married into the family for as long as anyone in Appaloosa can remember. Originally an outsider, she worked her way into Curley's heart in a way that none since have managed. Perhaps Esme is the one remaining link to repair the family's burnt bridges to the rest of the community.
   [419] 0xB92F67E54600DF04: Estela
   [41A] 0x9B73CCC6FDC85C5C: Ethan
   [41B] 0xB60B03C447F1272E: Ethan is unfortunately caught in the middle of his parent's troubled marriage. With his dad's time spent away from home and penchant for partying, young Ethan has grown even closer to his mom. Will he have to make do without a strong father figure to guide him?
   [41C] 0x02B2EADE52F32464: Evan
   [41D] 0xD86F332F779D0321: Wild Horse
   [41E] 0xB02218C8B946FDF3: Felipe
   [41F] 0xCF70B88D5F694281: Felipe is a gentle man who loves his wife and wants to give her the child she desperately craves. Unfortunately things aren't going as planned, and the only family he's currently shepherding is covered in fur. The longer he goes without a child to rear, the more pets he seems to accumulate. Is his life going to the dogs?

   [425] 0x70C6A0C6D66C32E3: Fox
   [426] 0x3B657FA7D9BE1AA7: Freebird
   [427] 0x3356698FA807AB76: "'Cause I'm freeeeeee, free birding!" Alright, so nobody will ever mistake Johnson's lyrics as 100% originals, and his blends of popular songs and off-key covers can get a bit grating, but naming his horse Freebird was certainly apropo for anyone who had a passing interest in his career. Freebird on the other hand is anything but, with moods ranging from nervous to downright mean, she'd prefer an afternoon in the box stall to roaming the countryside.
   [428] 0x6EB0CFD245438E3B: Frend
   [429] 0x4D175BD87ACDA697: Gavin
   [42A] 0xF4FDA7A106987E89: Stressed out and spurned by the very celebs Gavin used to rub shoulders with, he's escaped to the country where life moves at a slower pace. There's no room for error in the high stakes world of plastic surgery, and one malpractice lawsuit later left him disgraced and out of work. Wolfson's Hospital lept at the opportunity to bring a big city doctor on staff though, and he's working his way back up from the bottom.
   [42B] 0x70CD20D88F5492F1: Genna
   [42C] 0xE7EED824C8F0DFE7:

   [42F] 0xB1F24C81CFE9AF8D: Singleton
   [430] 0x9C87C8966FA0E8E4: Ginger
   [431] 0xD0B28958201415F8: Ginger is one troubled puppy! Passed from family to family, she eventually found her way to Vera's doorstep for some lessons in obedience. Although barely taller than a Sim's ankles, she's already a furry little bundle of destruction. Is there hope for turning this rough pup's life around?
   [432] 0xB7E81FCA12D57376: Glint 2.0
   [433] 0xB7E820CA12D574C9: Glint 3.0
   [434] 0x84A9AEE174CFA05E: Glint 3.0 is the Singleton's third thoroughly inept attempt at a thoroughbred. Fresh off the hooves of Glint 1.0 and Glint 2.0, will this third version meet with success? This poor horse is treated more like a commodity than a pet - hopefully he doesn't meet the same fate as his predecessors.
   [435] 0xED12FDC0CBA745FC: Gloria
   [436] 0xC08CF7CC135616F2: GooGoo
   [437] 0x67B881BF50BFE52A: Besides being saddled with a sickeningly sweet name, GooGoo has a pretty easy lot in life. Continually coddled by Kim, this sweet young foal gets the best of everything. Although he sometimes misses his real mom, Kim is overly eager to fill that role, feeding him with a bottle in one hand and carrot in the other. Will he still get all the loving attention he's grown accustomed to once he grows up?
   [438] 0xD4D5C2DD04595E01: Gosling
   [439] 0x238FB47876FBFFB5: Gracie
   [43A] 0xD9FA554F73BACC58: Gracie is a total sweetheart. Patriotic to a fault, she takes time away from her job at Wolfson's Research Facility to teach science classes at Crestview School, always dedicating herself to each child to ensure they succeed. However when she escapes from work, is there more to this lady than meets the eye? A wild side just beneath the surface is waiting to be unlocked by the right man in her life!
   [43B] 0x14DF20DE5D7B7E99: Gray
   [43C] 0xF2E793D8D91222B8: Grubb
   [43D] 0x2A02997F54A47FC9: Gurpal
   [43E] 0x3168C27F58796654: Gussie
   [43F] 0xB0C594941B17FDB4: Hailey
   [440] 0xEBC0CB4FAC19DBF1: Hailey is the typical girl next door, although for Zac and Kenji she just so happens to be the girl the next room over. Though single, when it comes to priorities in her life she's far more interested in lovable puppies than a loving relationship. Because she can't yet own a pup of her own, she spends as much time as possible in the local dog park fawning over others - and their owners.
   [441] 0x770A2F948B1EB185: Harley
   [442] 0x2A006214515B216E: Hennessey
   [443] 0x33449925EF61F40A: Hetty
   [444] 0xFD5C0F960FC8BA4A: Crazy cat lady is never a term Hetty would consider, but there's nothing healthy about living in denial. Maybe "crazy" is a bit of a stretch, but eccentric is certainly spot on. She lives as a recluse in her musty old Victorian home, as far from her neighbors as she can possibly get. Townsfolk give her a wide birth as nobody looks forward to one of her hyperbolic rants on modern society. Perhaps it's best that she sticks to her cats after all. 
   [445] 0xF5FDE9D5D1D54B74: Hiller
   [446] 0x5EBADBD60D613CE8: HipHop
   [447] 0x23AFB0C8C97BA532: Hobble
   [448] 0x89CF522620611A11: Honey
   [449] 0xFE2D130053D5A6A5: Honey is a veritable superstar in the world of country music. It isn’t just a façade, she truly lives the life. Her southern drawl has entranced many a man, and she doesn’t lack in southern hospitality either. She decided to give Midwest living a try to break the writer’s block that developed while attempting to record her next album.
   [44A] 0x9DFCF5C90F0BE016: Hopper

   [44E] 0xD4EAC2EDBB645BF6: Hunter
   [44F] 0xDB9535A414C2CCE5: Imogen
   [450] 0xD720592626B2D225: Imogen is the classic case of the child star with too much pressure to succeed in life. She always had natural beauty, and her presence on the stage was unrivaled. She made a great name for herself while avoiding the rut of a one hit wonder, until disaster suddenly struck. She found herself unexpectedly pregnant, and one botched plastic surgery later left her with a PR nightmare on her hands. She's escaped to the country to live incognito while time heals all wounds.
   [451] 0xF7B6C5A762346D52: Jacoby
   [452] 0x9AB6576C25006BEE: Jacquie
   [453] 0xAC66431120B76915: Jacquie Miller turns heads wherever she goes. Simply saying she's attractive would be doing her a disservice, and she's known around town for her friendly demeanor and kind acts of generosity to strangers. Not content to just be a mother to her own children, she takes any wayward folks under her wing. Her heart broke for the poor Riffin children, and she pays close attention to them to ensure Calvin raises them right.
   [454] 0x70EEA6C6D68D8E8A: Jak
   [455] 0x70EEA6C6D68D8E98: Jay
   [456] 0xD062D7A7DCF71584: Jazlyn
   [457] 0x78A671FD73351666: Jazlyn has been dealt a tough lot in life. Her husband is rarely home, and after getting married at a young age she feels like she's matured beyond her years. Will she find the courage to break out of her current rut and do something for herself again?
   [458] 0xA18DAB9ED821CC13: Stray Cat
   [459] 0x6DDEEBCAF9BCAC42: Jenner
   [45A] 0x3829E73313FEAB0C: Jenny
   [45B] 0x0908D665DC75B8BB: Jingle
   [45C] 0x72FFFBDE9278A347: Joey
   [45D] 0x405BEC77A6434FD4: Johnny
   [45E] 0xA312A7FA4C045E19: As long-time country songwriter, Johnny is in the twilight of his career. His success was ultimately bittersweet, as a life on the road led to the loss of a family who simply couldn't stand life without him anymore. Now he's the one who feels the sting of being alone. He recently invited his good friend Chuck to take the spare bedroom, but will his company be enough to fill the hole in his heart?
   [45F] 0x9F1F914F840C0925: Johnson
   [460] 0x73000DDE9278C1AD: Josy
   [461] 0xE0DEA7610F9974A2: Juanita
   [462] 0x6BE0AC996F6EBD3F: They say reality TV rots your brain, but for Juanita it was the launching pad to a fabulous career! After winning season one of "Dishes to Delicacy", a show that takes minimum wage dishwashers and turns them into top chefs, life couldn't seem to get any better. It was that very moment that she laid eyes on beefy Barrington, and a romance swiftly blossomed.
   [463] 0x0768D14317F2CCC3: Julian
   [464] 0x7D6A17DE98DDD23D: Kale
   [465] 0xBD426280BA58A499: Kalliopi
   [466] 0xF91FC63DC0F25242: Kanoa
   [467] 0xB810DE2EC4CE65BC: If people really got to know Kanoa, they probably wouldn't like what they found. As a Hawaiian transplant, people chalk up his flamboyant personality as a regional disconnect. Too many business trips and too many nights in hotel rooms have all shaped him into a skilled schmoozer - quick to strike up a conversation at a bar, and even quicker if a pretty lady catches his eye.
   [468] 0xD584FD3DAC822711: Kenji
   [469] 0x04FD3CADBB3FE090: Kenji is practical and content to pool his resources with his roommates while devoting his time to his true passion, archeology. He was drawn to the town of Appaloosa by the large dig site that’s long been something locals boast about. Beyond the tourist trap façade lie layers of dinosaur bones and traces of a ritualistic monument. What secrets await buried in the hillside?
   [46A] 0x54CB35AD562624F7: Kicker
   [46B] 0x297E6BAD3D9FB8A9: Kiffle
   [46C] 0x70F282C6D6913AE1: Kim
   [46D] 0xF37DD8ED154CCEAF: Kim is the artistic type, mostly content to whittle the days away painting animals and tending to her "babies". Her maternal clock is definitely ticking though, and as long as she's unable to get pregnant, she'll keep bringing more pets into her life. Will she get to become the mother she's always dreamed of being?
   [46E] 0xDD9AC1ADA321E10B: Kismet
   [46F] 0xB4BB693D9A775B91: Kizzy
   [470] 0x3FF506DE75D2D7C4: Lady
   [471] 0x3FF510DE75D2E8D0: Lark
   [472] 0x4610A59395629121: Li
   [473] 0x25457D8E96D9EEDE: Lionheart
   [474] 0x4610A59395629127: Lo
   [475] 0x31DED775066BBEA9: Lollypop
   [476] 0x6C33D357E9F6D66B: Loveland
   [477] 0x9BA1DAC49BF0C252: Maggie
   [478] 0x9B89F2C49BDC596D: Stray Dog
   [479] 0x9BD4D2C49C1C0E5D: Magpie
   [47A] 0xE4562E09478B3B5B: Maisy
   [47B] 0xF9FE832EF8709A22: Maisy Miller is the town's teen sweetheart. Trusted by her parents and loved by her teachers, everyone assumes she can do no wrong. That surface innocence has bought her plenty of freedom the normal teen might not enjoy. With her eyes set on Cruz, the cute boy across town, what sort of trouble might she actually find herself in?
   [47C] 0x3E93EDC4F7C56FA8: Marney
   [47D] 0x07B44F164AC8A45A: Marney leads a pretty easy life. As Sofia's latest toy, he's really just one large accessory to draw attention to her. When sunlight strikes his glistening white coat, there isn't a Sim around who won't turn his way for a closer look.
   [47E] 0x30B6FC29FB4A3726: Marshall
   [47F] 0x7CFB3133DFDFFD60: Martingale
   [480] 0xCD0DF4E383A2C810: Melody
   [481] 0xCDE9AB8328625F47: Midden
   [482] 0xC57B85C9D5BC98A8: Wild Horse
   [483] 0x1240D3834ED2708B: Miller
   [484] 0x00FEC20D5DD35D32: Minette
   [485] 0xF80AA1ACA6AAB7FF: Minette is the neglected member of the Bird family. Their name ought to be a dead giveaway; this family is more welcoming to a feathered flock than a big bundle of fur. Minette knows how to draw attention though, she's constantly hatching new plots to devour one of the home's plump and juicy birds.
   [486] 0x49AD578FFFBD29C2: Mollie
   [487] 0xE7CEE469C7E03DF7: Mothball
   [488] 0x63434AD118FDD5B3: Mothball may be the king kitty of the Lionheart household, but even he still bends to Pickles's will. Regardless of who's running the place, the other cats still look to him to be the oldest and wisest of the bunch.
   [489] 0xF2E9B08FCE8E5D75: Mozart
   [48A] 0xF870955B75896470: Mozart forges his own path in life. He formed a close bond with Jacquie as a kitten, and you can see it in his fiercely independent behavior. Try and give him a hard time and you'll find just how sharp this cat's claws can be!
   [48B] 0x2C67B55F78491FB3: Muffin
   [48C] 0x44523EE3B97EAB3F: As the youngest of three adult cats in the home, Muffin is in a precarious position. Of course Hetty loves all her cats, but there's a definite pecking order when it comes to the kitty chain of command.
   [48D] 0x40E4735E732D6908: Natalie
   [48E] 0xD5A7CA4563D3DCF8: Stray Cat
   [48F] 0xF982B27E44A92F01: Wild Horse
   [490] 0x6F7A0F13D57C5618: Noble
   [491] 0xA155EF88EFB5F9E2: Oopsie-Daisy
   [492] 0xBE9138D6E5D475BA: Oopsie-Daisy is another of the Marshall's many rescues. For a kitten it's a pretty decent life being pampered as if she were a true child. It's a tough position to be in though, because what happens if the Marshall's ever succeed in having a kid?
   [493] 0x4537F8B6ACE99386: Oriole
   [494] 0x73BCCF5CEBFF02EB: As the younger Bird sister, Oriole is the troublemaker in the family. It's not mean-spirited, she just has a knack for acquiring knick knacks - ones that aren't necessarily hers. Nobody will ever mistake her as a mastermind, but she's starting to turn quite the profit as the town thief.
   [495] 0x32BB6C492B419782: Oxendine
   [496] 0xAB189B419EF62456: Pantoufle
   [497] 0x660C1E473681223E: Pantoufle has a name to match his demeanor, that's to say he's quite the dandy. Over-styled and overly pampered, this pup’s personality is one only a celebrity like Imogen could enjoy. Don't look for him at the local dog park; he'd never mingle with such common rabble.
   [498] 0x92B6D4DE13B1F30D: Parr
   [499] 0x50ACAE403CD6D160: Parrott
   [49A] 0x06CB5178B15755E5: Parr-Teague
   [49B] 0xFE98C95B775B9F26: Patch
   [49C] 0x115FA2CA8DB6321D: Named for the cute black mark over one eye, Patch was adopted from the local fire station after an unexpected litter of Dalmatians were born. As an honoree member of the fire department, this pup struts around with head held high.
   [49D] 0x2F7F5E32123B5929: Patricia
   [49E] 0x7A275550D1BCFF69: As a stately lady with a high brow and stiff upper lip, Patricia Bedlington does not associate with the common folk. She vehemently dislikes anything improper, and the only conversations she chooses to engage in involve discussing the woefully lacking youth in today's society. As a strict upholder of "proper" values, she only wishes to live out her days by fully taking advantage of the wonderful environment Appaloosa Plains has to offer.
   [49F] 0xDDDC005B655B0472: Pelly
   [4A0] 0xD3F320FEBB403CE0: Petunia
   [4A1] 0x2CB8787205F30102: As the Curley's cat, Petunia leads a sheltered life. That's said quite literally - the many fences the Curley's constructed on their properly keep her quite strictly as an indoor cat.
   [4A2] 0xAF446FBA73F18EE6: Phinneas
   [4A3] 0x43BDDB7F7A5A1791: Pickles
   [4A4] 0xAEEFD71213B9F6AD: This momma cat rules the roost. As Hetty's personal favorite, she knows she has the authority to boss Mothball and Muffin around with few repercussions. If a cat wants something done in this household, they better run it by her first.
   [4A5] 0x68283F2A7F7A4F87: Stray Dog
   [4A6] 0xA9C24170E5DD3684: Pinkerton
   [4A7] 0xBA33785B50DF0A16: Pippa
   [4A8] 0x56AFEBD17A0BB4BA: Puggle
   [4A9] 0xB8632AC997C8C6FF: Quincy
   [4AA] 0x5A1A83F2064F6376: Quincy is the ideal example of a father in the traditional nuclear family. As a hard-working military man, he gives his all to provide for his family, and his selfless actions frequently benefit the entire community. He believes it's his responsibility to improve everything he lays his hands on.
   [4AB] 0x67E111FE7509DBE3: Ralston
   [4AC] 0xBD11004AF4384485: A handy dog for a handyman, Ralston is the trusty companion that any single guy would be happy to have around. Even in his adult age he's a master of the puppy stare that would melt any woman's heart, ensuring many "social" opportunities for his master.
   [4AD] 0xCF2716DABACC798E: Rascal
   [4AE] 0x6BDE9E6D604689B0: Stray Cat
   [4AF] 0xFF58E251A5749E29: Reynard
   [4B0] 0x462BC01BFD3908FE: Riffin
   [4B1] 0x59E10E2DB29440E9: Rodney
   [4B2] 0x619632D41C52997E: Rodney is the brains behind the Singleton brother's success. All the money in the world can't completely tear him away from his time in front of a computer screen, but he has found horse breeding to be a similarly stimulating activity.
   [4B3] 0xA50625DE1E5915F9: Rose
   [4B4] 0xA4BB25DE1E192A4A: Rush
   [4B5] 0xA3FB167337250717: Sable
   [4B6] 0xABD34ADE21ABE8F4: Sage
   [4B7] 0xABD35DDE21AC08BB: Sara
   [4B8] 0x34031E3DB16062A8: Schmidt
   [4B9] 0x8869628EB8F1BA3B: Schreckengast
   [4BA] 0xFF0C702D0325656B: Nova
   [4BB] 0x39937DE5D42D8D5A: Seymore
   [4BC] 0xA4344E1421E66150: Shadow
   [4BD] 0xA8F43DFEDDA2B844: Shadow is Chuck's trusty steed, and the pair have formed a close bond over many years and countless rodeos. Man and horse move as one, and Shadow won't trust anyone else in the saddle.
   [4BE] 0xF399907364B67DDB: Shaun
   [4BF] 0x6CDB7535E3C77AE7: Shawnee
   [4C0] 0x1F2161E59C645EF0: Shawnee is in touch with the land around him, and feels happiest out under the clear blue sky. Taking crops from a small seed all the way to the dinner table is just one of the ways he tends to his family. In his personal time he connects to the past by powering through historical literature.
   [4C1] 0xABF25CDE21C6B7C6: Shep
   [4C2] 0x3827ECA3A2518F0D: Shep is the definition of man's best friend. Hard working and loyal, he's just the type of dog any ranching family needs on their farm. Visitors may pause to wonder if Shep is actually the one running things on the ranch, and they wouldn't be far off the mark.
   [4C3] 0x42FA18ADF114F57D: Shepherd
   [4C4] 0xB03CEF083610BA0F: Stray Dog
   [4C5] 0xABEE40DE21C29F38: Sims
   [4C6] 0xF683FF35F9F56F37: Singleton
   [4C7] 0x2CAF804BEAC4A951: Sir-Dancelot
   [4C8] 0xEBA5BACB93C774A3: Skedaddle
   [4C9] 0xFBCC793A22E7BB2B: Life's pretty simple when you're the pampered pet of a country superstar. Skedaddle always has to be looking her best as she never knows when a pesky paparazzi may pop out and take her picture. With a glistening white coat and a bedazzled saddle, she's always ready for a ride around town!
   [4CA] 0xD6FF057353C4AA72: Sofia
   [4CB] 0x47A4269554FA6848: Caution, cougar on the prowl! Sofia is taking back her life, and as far as she's concerned she's 40 years young.

   [4D6] 0x71C42EDE01840420: Tate
   [4D7] 0x48FB8D59808F7442: Tate Curley is as sour as his home is old, take that as you may. Years of fending off businessmen and local politicians have made him introverted and untrusting of visitors. As the head of the town's oldest family though, many local secrets would go to the grave with him.

   [4DE] 0x807D8ADE091EEC30: Vera
   [4DF] 0x6C300FB8AC9E75E4: Despite her older appearance, Vera still walks with a snap in her step, and woe unto the dog who can't keep pace. She has as little tolerance for an improperly behaved Sim as she does for a pup, so stay in line or find yourself put in your place.

   [4EC] 0x59B800FCB2F83B56: Zac's the town's bad boy, but beneath that gruff exterior is a decent guy with his head screwed on straight. The neighbors see him come and go late at night on his hog, or occasionally taking a stroll with his pet snake in hand. What they don't see is his dedication in the kitchen as he labors to rise from a line cook to his dream of becoming a top chef.

   [5C3] 0xE0D6BE3E3E2A81F7: At one time Appaloosa Plains was a sleepy ranching township, its only claim to fame being a garish tourist trap that drew in the occasional curious passerby. However, a recent influx of city slickers has turned the area into a bustling hub of activity. They keep arriving with their stacks of Simoleons, retrofitting the town with modern amenities while eagerly believing they've acquired their own slice of country paradise. The clash between old and new is readily apparent, with some elderly die-hards clinging to the remaining vestiges of life as they knew it. Will the town come together in a new era of prosperity, or will the generational clash leave a clear line drawn in the sand?
