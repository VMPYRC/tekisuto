   [301] 0xB2AB7BDD0BF6959A: Loft / 1 Bath - Although the original farmhouse was incinerated a few years ago, the encroaching swamp saved the barn. Undaunted, the eccentric owner has made the barn into a livable if not luxurious space.

   [303] 0xA7155DD19F7AE72B: 2BR / 1 Bath - Score outdoor living at its best with this affordably priced home. With its separate bedroom pavilion, and slightly dark and outdated exterior, it’s perfect for the small family on a budget.
   [304] 0xA7ED20295EFFEA6F: 1BR / 1 Bath - Although not the most fashionable of residences, this house is definitely livable. The enclosed porch adds additional living space.
   [305] 0x38AFC2D50822BDE8: 1BR / 1 Bath - Just a little TLC could turn this dilapidated property into a charming starter home. However, it would take a lot of work to make it really nice.
   [306] 0xDBEEB824D8AF567A: Studio / 1 Bath - The ultimate in simple living, this modest house features two decks, an abundant water supply, and a mostly leak free roof. This affordable house is ideal for a nature lover… or at least one who loves mosquitoes.

   [3B2] 0x79E50229684D8E74: What began as square catalog house grew porches and dormers and finally a cupola. Clearly this is an abode with ambitions.
   [3B3] 0x40756E85F6834E72: With neoclassical proportions and a well designed floor plan, this house is rarely available to the first time homeowner. Although it’s probably what many of us envision for a starter home, only the rare buyer can afford this much charm once in a blue moon.
   [3B4] 0xC17869436AC0FA80: This house harkens back to yesteryear, evoking another era that has blown with the breeze. Grand living can still be found here; with its old growth willows, private pond, and many verandas, tomorrow will always be another day.
   [3B5] 0xF5165BFF8A27BA6F: Borrowing elements from Mount Versimnon and Montisimno, this stately home could be considered a modern castle…and here, every Sim’s home is his or her castle!
   [3B6] 0xE4F5D39F7BE75FD4: Yo, check this out! More urban than most other houses around, this house has serious street cred’. Nothin’ sez urban than red brick and matching pilasters.
   [3B7] 0x5EE57A50E195FE1E: We’re certain we‘ve seen this house on the opening credits of a cable mini-series. At any rate, we encourage you to brush up on your croquet and stock up on bloomers and petticoats if you want to spend any significant time here.
   [3B8] 0x038B02C310AAF145: The stolid front of this house defines its equally no-nonsense interior. We’re sure the living rooms of this house have hosted many important local dignitaries in interminable tea parties to which fortunately we have never been invited.
   [3B9] 0xCD6BBE9239C8E686: With ample living space beneath its steep alpine roof, this Summer Cottage has been attracting visitors during the warm months for many years. Perhaps it’s time for less seasonal guests…
   [3BA] 0xA3DA1FBF3928A1CE: Shootin’ the breeze is easier from a porch and even more fun when drinkin’ your favorite cold beverage. ‘Course for that you needs a ‘fridgerator. So when given the chance to build anywhere in the swamp, this place seems like the most logical locale.
   [3BB] 0xF3C878181CD48453: This sweet home is a sugary confection ideal for the young couple. We’d think the stork would be making a delivery to this house very soon.

   [3F9] 0x535D886ED2CE6E83: Buddy Bailey, more than anything else, is a painter. He loves it with all that he is, but he just can’t seem to get by on an artist’s wage. Gala believes that just because she’s finally done with school, it doesn’t mean the party has to end! Will this couple be able to figure out how to live the lifestyle they love, and be able to pay the mortgage?
   [3FA] 0x74E67C28B51E092E: From the cookhouse of an expensive restaurant to a backyard crawfish cookout, Mary Baker wields the tools of the kitchen with deft culinary skills and technique. So much so that she has made a nice little life for herself and her two sons. Just don’t cross her, unless you want to feel a mother’s wrath!
   [3FB] 0xAFDDFB9ED1034682: The origins of the Bayless name are a bit hard to track down. Written records (where legible) even two generations back use the "less," "liss" and even "lies" suffix varietals.

   [51A] 0x2D70809EAD647C83: {OpSourceFirstName} has a really good idea about the new medical process and has tested it successfully several times on a medical training dummy. Of course, to start this clinical study correctly {OpSourceFirstName} will need the assistance of another brain specialist. {OpSourceFirstName} thinks {OpTarget} is just the specialist for the job.

   [532] 0x4A56B6EDF9038CF4: "You seem like a nice person. We understand the need to not be fraternizing with certain people around here. All will be forgiven with one final task. If you could convince a certain individual that the current police surge on crime is unnecessary, we will pretend that all of this never happened and we don't even know what a hospital is."

   [539] 0x58CB0419631FE24C: An outbreak of Lolcosis appears to have broken out around town and the hospital needs help identifying and handling the problem areas. Could {OpOwner} devote some time visiting local buildings and conducting some tests?
   [53A] 0x388950DA91C763F0: {OpOwner} didn't make it in time and the hospital had to send someone else to deal with the outbreak. For shame!

   [53F] 0x67941F6BF7F89C1E: The entire floral department had to be treated for Lolcosis, but it looks like the disease didn't spread much further than that. That covers the current run of targets, but it might be best to head to the Hospital and assist them.
   [540] 0xA8C5D97880AB3EC3: {OpOwner}'s help was critical to the success of the entire operation! Thanks to hours of selfless service many lives were saved!

   [543] 0x8CCA0EBD6E03A69E: The administrator has thought about the equipment issue and discussed it with his top advisers.

One of the council members, {OpTarget} voting on the equipment's approval is facing a tough re-election campaign right now and could provide the pivotal and popular supporting vote. {OpOwner} should discuss this with {OpTarget}.

   [54B] 0x4FC6230F78F90520: {OpSourceFirstName} is willing to take a look at the hospital's research, but is currently far too busy worrying about the election. {OpOwner} should scratch {OpSourceFirstName}'s back by convincing several locals to vote in the upcoming election.

   [555] 0xD3A9EFB12DE6BD41: {OpOwner} is at the level where it's important to develop contacts outside of the hospital. If {OpOwner} wants to have clinical trials approved and new equipment greased through the bureaucracy, it is important to have good friends within the local government. {OpOwner} should go make a friend or two at City Hall.

   [559] 0x643EDD4286ABA509: {OpOwner} achieved total victory with a near omniscient grasp of all things medical. The competition was dominated and a pile of awards were brought home to the hospital. The Hospital is quite pleased with the performance.
   [55A] 0x30E1CDE89206B4C7: The Science Facility is holding a medical knowledge competition soon and the hospital wants one of their best doctors to go in and take it by storm. They'd like {OpOwner} to attend the competition and win it, or at least put on a good showing. It would be good publicity for the hospital.
   [55B] 0xC2B860031D8BC1F7: {OpOwner} missed the competition completely! Luckily, the hospital sent a couple of other doctors as well. Unfortunately the administration isn't too pleased with {OpOwner}.
   [55C] 0x5CD3A7421392F50C: "Attend Competition" at {OpTarget} for a cash reward, performance boost, and relationship boost with hospital co-workers.

   [55F] 0x9EB3C88B21137C5D: While {OpOwner} didn't win the competition, victory came really close and was only lost to world renowned surgeon Nigel Balkstein. The Hospital was hoping for a win, but a close second is fairly decent publicity still.
   [560] 0x099CB0C8739A6D0A: Well done! With doctors like {OpOwner}, and the hospital is sure to maintain a great image with the townsfolk. Ultimately, this means fewer lawsuits!
   [561] 0x123DCFDEB5F741BE: The hospital administrators are starting to worry about the hospital's public image and would like their veteran employees to be a little more aware of the local populace and its opinion of the hospital. They want doctors to go around and meet local Sims in order to put on a good public face.
   [562] 0xFC6B7C46E81FB833: Meet {OpNumEventsGoal} new Sims then return to work for a relationship boost with hospital staff, a cash reward, and a performance boost.

   [565] 0x762E9F5085C0678F: There was significant damage to some incredibly valuable equipment at the hospital. The police are looking into it but the hospital administration would like an internal investigation conducted as well. {OpOwner} has been selected to head up the investigation. The logical first step is to investigate the scene of the incident.
   [566] 0x5AC70B2D4BB29154: "Investigate Scene" at the Hospital after work to find clues.

   [56A] 0xC24BF4175E6CBD10: It looks like someone simply knocked over the device and ran. The device is located in a secure area, so the culprit is someone with the proper access card. After examining the security logs it looks like 3 Sims were in this area the night of the crime. {OpOwner} should speak to them.
   [56B] 0xED85851F08095569: "Question" the three Sims to see if they have alibis or information about the crime.

That's weird...the only place I could've left it was the Bistro! I hope I'm not in trouble!" Looks like its time to go check with the Bistro to see if the lost security card can be found.
   [571] 0x0079D31F172AF5D0: "Search for Card" at the Bistro to see if {OpOwner} can track down the missing security card.
   [572] 0x0543F5C320C0038A: Investigate on {OpTarget}
   [573] 0x1EB3CA857F468118: "Alright, alright. I stole the card and used it. I just couldn't believe that the hospital would charge me so much money for a 5 minute operation. I was so angry and it just seemed like a good idea at the time to smash the equipment in revenge. I will go turn myself in and accept whatever punishment is necessary."
   [574] 0x925F73039B565D8C: The manager couldn't find the card in the lost and found, but there are only a couple of Sims with access to it. {OpOwner} should check with {OpTarget}, who was on duty that night at the Bistro, who should have been the one to pick up the card if it was left there.
   [575] 0x707BDAFE05AD9CC5: "Question About Card" with {OpTarget} to see if any information about the lost card can be found.
   [576] 0xF2462DE02F8C663F: Question {OpTarget}
   [577] 0xDC8578CE36315F67: It was a good thing {OpOwner} was on the job because the police were still stuck in the exploratory stages of the investigation. The hospital administration is happy to see the investigation conclude successfully and are very pleased with {OpOwner}'s extracurricular work.
   [578] 0xC019913C5AB1C59E: Return to work to announce your success.
   [579] 0x291F4E14FBF11F4C: Return to Work
   [57A] 0xC09DDCCDD0AEA84C: In a competitive environment there are always some Sims who rub each other the wrong way. Unfortunately, the aggression between two popular doctors is starting to cause problems at the hospital. The boss would like {OpOwner} to try to settle this down before administrative measure need to be taken. Speak to {OpTarget} about the problem first.
   [57B] 0x06207E85352CB685: "Discuss Conflict" with {OpTarget} to see what the issues are.

   [57E] 0x52553B965400BA3B: {OpSourceFirstName} wouldn't really have a problem with {OpTargetFirstName}, except {OpTargetFirstName} has a tendency to hog lab time and prioritize other lab requests lower than personal projects. If {OpOwner} can convince {OpTargetFirstName} to be fair with the lab time, {OpSourceFirstName} agrees to drop all hostility.
   [57F] 0x92B776A643C53390: "Discuss Lab Issue" with {OpTarget} to see if there is any way to better distribute the lab assignment time.

   [581] 0x73AE6C6CF8CFBE1E: The party is planned. Time to see if {OpTarget} will bury the hatchet.
   [582] 0x442741A39AA39E7A: {OpTargetFirstName} is exhausted from being overworked. Maybe there has been some misprioritization in lab work after all. {OpTargetFirstName} is willing to fix the schedule, but first wants to blow off some steam at a {OpOwner} party! If {OpOwner} could find some time to throw a party, {OpTargetFirstName} will begin work on the new lab schedule.
   [583] 0xECAEE497F3F8AF4F: Throw a party and invite {OpTarget} to get cooperation.
   [584] 0x2B6C3A6A0F83AC35: Invite {OpTarget} to a party
   [585] 0xB4E02679818260C3: I just love a good party! Thank you so much for throwing such a fantastic event. I will speak with {OpSourceFirstName} immediately to resolve any scheduling issues. I'm sure the boss will be pleased as well.
   [586] 0x3EE5F47BD692B8B2: "Report In" to {OpTarget} to see if everything will be fixed.
   [587] 0x4FC197ABDCB5BAB8: Report In to {OpTarget}
   [588] 0xD64E4DA23940BFAB: {OpOwner} has heard nothing but complaints from the hospital's diagnostic staff about a delay in a vital medical equipment delivery. It's starting to cause productivity problems! {OpOwner} should look into this situation to solve the problem. One staff member suggested {OpOwner} pays a visit to the business that should deliver the equipment.

   [58C] 0xB86AFF2B84C9BB7C: The helpful warehouse manager at the medical equipment company says City Hall hasn't approved the equipment for use in this neighborhood yet. The paper work is completely jammed into the bureaucratic machine! {OpOwner} should convince {OpTarget} to move the paper work through the approval process a bit more quickly. 
   [58D] 0xF481A9BCDDF71B75: "Discuss Certification Process" with {OpTargetFirstName}. Be sure to be on a solid relationship standing first.
   [58E] 0xE220DB8317A74A6F: Discuss Certification Process with {OpTarget}
   [58F] 0xC282B3A1F92192F5: {OpSourceFirstName} wanted to help, but wasn't able to push the approval through. {OpSourceFirstName} was able to point {OpOwner} to the City Hall records department room containing some crucial files. The solution to the problem can be found somewhere in those records!
   [590] 0x9BE35DE81AFA7D0E: "Check Public Records" at City Hall to find out more about the problem.
   [591] 0x4C34B17C576E17FC: Check Public Records at City Hall
   [592] 0x41A4AE8D337D0E0A: The administrator is quite dissatisfied with the status of this equipment issue, but feels this isn't the right moment to enter the political forum to fight a battle. The administrator will think about a possible solution and how {OpOwner} can help!
   [593] 0x2A730530C40ED4BE: After a brief (and educational!) tour of the records department, {OpOwner} started digging. Apparently, two rival council members chose the medical equipment approval as their latest battleground and the issue was indefinitely stalled. {OpOwner} should report to the hospital to see what the administrator thinks about this latest development.
   [594] 0xB78667DA245F6133: Go to Work to report in and receive relationship with the boss, money, and a performance boost.

   [59A] 0xC13A9D8DADFB530B: The owner is never at the store in the mornings, so he's absolutely befuddled as to who could be the culprit. The morning clerk, {OpTarget}, may have the answers I need. The two of us should chat.

   [59E] 0xCA65D085F0C42A0A: {OpSource} is pretty sure the culprit was wearing a uniform commonly worn by thugs of the local crime syndicate. {OpTarget} is known to be involved with the syndicate. I should question {OpTarget}, or get ready to dole out a bribe to get the answers I need.

   [5A6] 0x6605A4B2685E67A0: It appears nobody minds the tragic lack of fruit at the supermarket, mostly due to a new presence on the local fruit scene. Why is it that {OpTarget} has such good prices? I've got questions for this purveyor of apples.

   [5AF] 0xA30990605D69091E: Jackpot! I found the remnants of a tattered fruit box stolen from the supermarket, as well as the deposit slip for a fat check that far exceeds {OpSource}'s salary. I should report my findings to the owner of the supermarket.

   [5CC] 0x4C31B5AB88506D96: {OpSource} crumbled like a week-old coffee cake that's been stuck under the seat at the stadium. {MC.He}{FC.She} admitted to accepting a bribe in exchange for the bad call.

   [6A8] 0xC88BFCFF85A49436: {OpSource} is fairly convinced the next door neighbor, {OpTarget}, is guilty of the gnome kicking. I should rummage through {OpTarget}'s garbage to see if I can find any evidence of wrong doing. Maybe then {OpSource} can bring the gnome out of hiding.

   [6AC] 0x482BF9A496516337: Why would {OpTargetFirstName} own shoes with toes so mangled, presumably from kicking a gnome, that they needed to be thrown away? Very peculiar. I should speak to {OpTargetFirstName} about the shoes.

   [6B0] 0xD6A23B83049B4DF0: {OpTarget} was relieved to hear about an end to the gnome abuse. The poor battered gnome will soon be comfortable in the sun once again. As for me, I earned my pay and solved the case.
   [6B1] 0xDFB715700FAF8274: {OpSourceFirstName} confessed to kicking the gnome and to having pronounced anger management issues. {OpSourceFirstName} agreed to stop kicking the gnome and to seek counciling. I should tell {OpTarget} the good news.

   [6B5] 0x71301E3664AE135C: I just got a call from {OpTarget}. It seems every night someone or something is bruising {OpTargetFirstName}'s poor toes. It seems my cases get weirder every day. I should speak to {OpTarget} about who might be doing this wham-bang toe job.

   [6B9] 0x3641F7661FB5F90B: {OpSourceFirstName} has long had qualms with a certain next door neighbor. Seems preposterous that the neighbor, {OpTarget}, would go on a nightly toe smashing rampage, but who knows? I should speak to {OpTarget} about this accusation.

   [6BC] 0x0DCBF772A1C73EDA: Speak to {OpTarget}
   [6BD] 0x3F6D2A5E627ED00A: The neighbor began cackling like a hyena who has had too much laughing gas at the dentist. It appears the real suspect is {OpSource}. Every night {OpSource} sleep walks and kicks a garden gnome. I should research sleep walking a little bit at the local hospital to see if the facts line up.

   [6C1] 0x724F5EA18762C6B3: {OpTarget} wasn't surprised to hear about kicking the gnome while sleepwalking. Doesn't change the fact that I was surprised by it all. The gnome is going to be padded to preserve {OpTargetFirstName}'s toes. I'm going to take my fee and look for my next case.
   [6C2] 0x94054A0DDD375AC9: According to the docs the sleepwalking theory makes a lot of sense. It seems {OpTarget} has consulted with the hospital before for sleepwalking. I should tell {OpTarget} that I solved the case.

   [6C6] 0x7597ABDF54789D82: {OpTarget} wants to hire me to do some cyber warfare. Ideally this will be a big case involving data theft and piracy, though I'm sure it's just a forum quibble I need to settle. I should interview {OpTarget} for the details.

   [6CA] 0x4D6B7B7E9B421AED: Some days I hate my job. {OpSource} is worried that {OpTarget} has been saying mean things about {MC.him}{FC.her} on a forum both of them frequent. It's my job to hack into {OpTarget}'s computer to set things straight. Ugh.

   [6CE] 0x41B0F87EBB6140F0: {OpTarget} gasped when I mentioned I used the term "noopen poopen." Apparently I used a little too much force in this forum skirmish. Nonetheless, {OpTarget} is pleased and I got paid. Case closed.
   [6CF] 0x8FB53527A20B6B74: I'm not proud of myself, but I went online and called {OpSource} a "noopen poopen," which is apparently something really mean in some online circles. I should tell {OpTarget} the job is done.

   [6D7] 0x98FF6785E6C5763C: {OpSource} wants me to hack into the local business bureau's database to clear up a slight "credit mistransaction." Ethics aren't my department -- I'll do the hacking and {OpSourceFirstName} will need to sleep at night.

   [6DB] 0xC533020F8C690BB7: {OpTarget} didn't exactly take the news as I explained. "Good, I can go shopping now," said {OpTargetFirstName}. I wanted to explain the benefits and virtues of a good, honest credit score. But that's not my line of work. I accepted payment and said goodbye.
   [6DC] 0xDC560814F5BABDB5: I was able to hack into the creditor's database and swap a few 1s with a few 0s. Nothing I did was too illegal, but my tracks are clear. They are always clear. I should report back to {OpTarget}.

   [6E4] 0x753339E9291CF217: {OpTarget} hacked into {OpSource}'s personal computer, stole some files, and used them to earn an ill-gotten promotion from work. {OpSourceFirstName} wants me to obtain evidence so that all wrongs can be righted. I should hack into {OpTargetFirstName}'s computer.

   [6E8] 0x0C5541CEBF919232: {OpTarget} is still seething with rage, but my job was done to the letter. I collected payment and bid adieu to this cyberspace double cross.
   [6E9] 0x9F3D70CC5724A716: {OpSource} has the setup of a novice hacker. Nothing but a crummy firewall and sloppy password protector barred my way. I took the files, left a few surprises, and got out. I should report back to {OpTarget} with the news.

   [6F1] 0xA1F388F1506D6D9A: I asked {OpSource} to mentally re-trace any footsteps taken over the last few hours. It appears {OpSourceFirstName} made a brief stop at beach, which means my first stop will be to snoop for clues there.

   [6FE] 0x3B3B9720B31210D9: I was able to convince {OpSource} to hand over the wallet. {OpSourceFirstName} claimed to have found it on the ground. As usual, I heard the defense "I was going to return it!" Right. I should return the wallet to {OpTarget}.

   [70E] 0x8683F2060616D355: {OpTarget} is the sly, shady sort. I'm bothered by jokers stealing other folks' credit cards. I either need to get close to {OpTargetFirstName} and be convincing enough to get the cards, or just settle for a bribe.

   [712] 0xCD0D32F064AC1A08: {OpTarget} may need shopaholic counseling. The second I returned the cards {OpTargetFirstName}'s eyes lit up like a coyote stumbling across a wounded deer. Madness. This case is closed.
   [713] 0x4865486C07D5B7DC: {OpSource} seems like a con-artist, but I'm not being paid to investigate {OpSourceFirstName}'s dealings. Maybe in the future. For now, I need to return the credit cards to {OpTarget}.

   [725] 0xA41B7F8CB38F86EE: This is heart breaking. Thankfully, it's not my heart to break. {OpTargetFirstName}'s gal doesn't even mention him -- no pictures, no emails, no blog posts…it's as if she doesn't care. I should break the news to him so that he doesn't propose like a fool.

   [75B] 0x1FCCE75D996A988D: I found an odd chemical compound around the super market. If my school years serve me right, it's the compound HyroSimoxoNooper. Why would this be in a tomato of all things? I should hack the scientific database and do some research.

   [75F] 0x046AB26CB01C6F14: Oh, my stomach! HyroSimoxoNooper is a unique mutagen that provides immediate health benefits, but terrible long-term side effects. Oh, I don't even want to read the list.

   [764] 0x4E716C19324C427F: The supermarket was aghast at what they were selling and the produce was immediately pulled off the shelves. They won't be stocking through that supplier any longer. I was told prices were raised because customers seemed so happy with the produce, but with the return of the old produce comes the return of old prices.

I'm humbled, but this portion of the royalty check will soon soothe my pride.
   [784] 0xD9EE5E9980ACCF1C: The bookstore owner looked at me like an absolute loon. Apparently the notion of book thieves is too hilarious to be remotely plausible. I feel like I'm being had. I should confront {OpTarget} about this supposed book theft.

   [8A9] 0xEEF5135519C2FA3D: Yep, {OpSource} has it bad for a local named {OpTarget}. {OpSourceFirstName} is willing to pay me to ask around town to see if {OpTargetFirstName} has a crush. I hate playing cupid... not.

   [8AC] 0x9DC26D087CC9BDA4: Question {OpNumEventsCurrent}/{OpNumEventsGoal} Sims
   [8AD] 0x39AA1DB4E1E6D720: I didn't lie to {OpTarget}, per se. I just didn't reveal all of the facts. I also didn't give my professional opinion. I did lead {OpTargetFirstName} to believe that {OpSource} had a crush, which was enough to get me paid and off the case.
   [8AE] 0x6B1E2BBF44D2B7C4: The evidence of a crush is entirely inconclusive, but I'm worried that if I tell {OpTarget} no, I won't get paid. I'll need to play my cards carefully when I report in to {MB.him}{FB.her}.

   [8B1] 0xA6F0C03C4A4CF537: Report In
   [8B2] 0x1F9EF4D283B185BB: {OpTarget} is one love sick individual. After one phone call I'm inclined to call a doctor, but prognosis isn't my line of business. I agree to a quick interview to see how I can be of assistance.

   [8B5] 0xC9354A551E87EECA: Interview {OpTarget}
   [8B6] 0x8DE7960A005F73CC: {OpSource} hasn't had a date in a long, long time. I think it's been so long the coroner's office can declare {OpSourceFirstName}'s love life legally dead. {OpSourceFirstName} wants me to ask around to see if I can find another lonely single.

   [8BA] 0xB2461BDF6A645AA7: {OpTarget} doesn't have a lot of hope left, but news of {OpSource}'s potential availability seemed to liven spirits, mine included. I took my payment and wished {OpTargetFirstName} luck.
   [8BB] 0xB09778516DF86745: It seems {OpSource} may be the fellow lonely soul {OpTarget} needs. I'll deliver the information and hopefully earn a few Simoleons in the process. Time to report in.

   [8BF] 0x877172A1B3ED7788: People these days. Always worried about what so and so said about them. {OpTarget} is hiring me to quash a rumor that's floating around. I should interview {OpTarget} first for details.

   [8C2] 0xF3D28AB363BD8C13: Interview {OpTarget}
   [8C3] 0xB7CA76754AC03627: Apparently, {OpTarget} referred to {OpSource} as a "llama brained gnome herder." Seems honorary to me, but {OpSourceFirstName} claims it's highly insulting. I'm being paid to dispel the rumor amongst several locals.

   [8C7] 0x41BCF10212932222: {OpTarget} breathed a sigh of relief when I told the news. Hopefully, everyone can put this llama brained stuff behind them. Case closed.
   [8C8] 0x6A02CD61F107AEE6: Now that the rumors have been dispelled I should report back to {OpTarget}, gather my payment, and close this case.

   [8CC] 0xBE721A0B664DB4F5: One of the neighborhood stylists has a beef that I need to solve for {MB.him}{FB.her}. {OpTarget} is convinced a pair of {MB.his}{FB.her} prized designer shoes were stolen when {MB.he}{FB.she} was last at the day spa. I should check in with {MB.him}{FB.her} to start this case.

   [8CF] 0xAE65585FC08A7DFC: Report In
   [8D0] 0x916264C7807F52AA: Apparently, the shoes were stolen while {OpSource} was in the middle of a therapeutic mud bath. {MC.He}{FC.She} suspects a rival, {OpTarget}, stole the shoes. I should check with {OpTarget} first then.

   [8D4] 0xD23DB40BA66CE1AB: {OpTarget} claims to have nothing to hide and warmly invited me to dust for prints. I think I will -- dusting for clues is one of the things I do best.

   [8D7] 0xF65D181C19A64DFA: Dust for Prints
   [8D8] 0xBF44E3FE31AF39C0: I found a set of prints on the property that are all over the house -- but they don't belong to {OpSource}. I also noticed, or should I say was assaulted, by the overpowering stench of fish. Something fishy is afoot! I should snoop for clues at a fairly public, centralized fishing spot.

   [8DB] 0xB77B509330042BEB: Snoop for Clues
   [8DC] 0x3539FDA874A42269: It seems I found the shoes, or at least prints left by the shoes. Someone came to this spot to fish while wearing heels. That just doesn't seem comfortable! I should hack into the spa's client database to see if any of the recurring clients are fishermen.

   [8E3] 0x45792535342D2421: Confront {OpTarget}
   [8E4] 0xE325DE46BAF0B63F: You think a {MB.man}{FB.woman} would come clean when being confronted about stealing a lady's shoes. Nope. {OpTarget} won't say a word, but perhaps a bribe of a few Simoleons will loosen his lips.
   [8E5] 0x80358C599914A744: "Bribe" {OpTarget}
   [8E6] 0xB6A08159B8993066: The Case of the Freshwater Pumps
   [8E7] 0x46BE929E6BA7FFA6: Bribe {OpTarget}
   [8E8] 0x38220322EDBECDD4: {MB.He}{FB.She} took the bribe like a baby being offered a lollipop. Sucker. The fisherman admits to loving a pair of sensible heels, but claims {MB.he}{FB.she} wasn't the one who took the shoes. The two huge skis {MB.he}{FB.she} calls feet prove that the shoes wouldn't fit {MB.him}{FB.her} anyways. I should confront the second suspect, {OpTarget}.

   [8EC] 0x2D2E9316521E53FF: {OpTarget} was delighted to see the return of her beloved shoes, but was a bit horrified to encounter the smell. Raw fish don't mix well with designer heels, apparently. Luckily I'm not in the shoe cleaning business. I took my fee and called it a day. Case closed.
   [8ED] 0x72CCC4255C70264D: {OpSource} spilled the beans. {MC.He}{FC.She} took the shoes and is more ashamed than I care to admit. At least {MC.he}{FC.she} loved the shoes, though I'm not sure how that helps. Regardless, I have them now and can return them to {OpTarget} to conclude this case.

   [8F1] 0xF841FF95EA30A97E: It seems the rather eccentric proprietor of the local mausoleum has a problem with the graveyard. I'm dying to discover what this case entails. I should visit the graveyard and pay a visit to the mausoleum.

   [8F5] 0x8DB04AFDE319F529: Urns and gravestones have been disappearing from the graveyard and the grave digger has no idea what's happening. I mentioned that the dead were obviously dying to get out but he didn't find that funny. I should snoop for clues around the crime scene.

   [8F9] 0xB53EAE30D082F480: How disgustingly odd. There's goo all over the place. Frankly, I've never seen anything like it. I should head to the science facility to analyze this. I'm dying to find out what it is. 
   [8FA] 0x9DBBBC0CC6FC2B99: "Analyze Mystery Goo" at the Science Facility

   [8FD] 0x5D53782310F7C66B: Incredible! The science geeks claim this disgusting goo is ectoplasm -- a substance found only on ghosts. It seems the dead are restless. I should conduct a stakeout at the graveyard to see if the scene is truly dead. Gulp.

   [900] 0x49D20EA02C7AB0BA: Conduct Stakeout
   [901] 0x2346A33C80E5D16A: Those two characters were certainly shady, but not quite the transparent shade of a ghost. One of them dropped a shopping list with corn starch and food coloring. I should search the Sim's garbage for additional clues.

   [904] 0x63159E5A16E94C65: Search Garbage Can
   [905] 0x3310449DE9504DB5: The trash can was topped off with empty containers full of corn starch and food coloring -- the ingredients for synthetic ectoplasm! It's all a fake. The culprit is trying to pin this on the dead and failing. I should have known -- dead Sims tell no false tales. I should confront the culprit to end this.

   [908] 0x62F3710FD7F039BC: Confront {OpTarget}
   [909] 0x444F56DA0103ECE8: The grave digger was shocked, but ultimately not too bewildered. It seems folks see a lot of odd things in the grave digging industry. I'm sufficiently creeped out to take my payment and walk away. Case closed.
   [90A] 0xEFB9A40EDA5B063C: The culprit fell apart like ashes scattered to the wind. Apparently, {OpSource} has been stealing gravestones and urns in hopes of finding a long lost love…in ghost form. {OpSource} agreed to return the stolen property. I should relay this to the grave digger at the mausoleum.

   [90E] 0x1D7E24DACFFA07E4: I just got a call from {OpTarget}, who noticed that a prized ring was missing. One needs no more notification of stolen jewelry than a naked ring finger. I should interview {OpTargetFirstName} for facts.

   [912] 0xF54DA486BA69E3B3: {OpTarget} left the ring in the dining room, then left for work. The cops couldn't find any evidence, but I'm not sure the fuzz can find a ring that isn't made of dough and covered in sugar. I should dust for prints in the dining room.

   [916] 0x19362BE15F80FA72: I found the prints, but they don't seem to match with any prints in my limited files. I should stop by the police station to run these prints against their database.

   [91E] 0x140922EA210B1A48: {OpSource} claims to be innocent, as well as a good friend of {OpTarget}. It appears the two had coffee the other day. I should question {OpTargetFirstName} to see if {OpSource}'s story checks out.

   [921] 0xCA7BD104925091D3: Question {OpTarget}
   [922] 0x37D30DA6785BFBE7: Seems our suspect was telling the truth. Strange that {OpSource} would leave out such a significant detail. Something seems fishy. I should snoop around {OpSourceFirstName}'s house and see if I can find out what it is.

   [926] 0x212BCC3C667B11E2: {OpTarget} got real nervous when I showed up with the ring and just started blabbing. Seems {MB.he}{FB.she} was trying to frame my previous suspect for stealing it. Can't pull a trick like that on me. {OpTargetFirstName} paid up… even giving me a little extra. Case closed.
   [927] 0x93873B6183BB4DA6: I found the ring right here, tucked in a corner of the room! It looks like someone intentionally hid it. Why would someone hide the ring in the house where they stole it from? Well, might as well return it.

   [92B] 0x8A1225E56905ED8F: I'm still not comfortable with the idea of mutant produce in my town. I'm curious if others have already experienced the side effects. I should ask a number of Sims around town if they have experienced food issues.

   [92F] 0xD62F7AAC41B24310: The entire town is abuzz with worries and concerns over the food. The bistro, diner, supermarket -- all of them seem to be dishing out bad produce. I should eat at the bistro myself to see what I can find out.

   [933] 0x2102E39B6CDAA0F9: The waiters and staff were reluctant to discuss the ingredients for the meal. That's odd and I don't like it one bit. I should interview the chef, {OpTarget}, to see what's going on.

   [937] 0x713B7254B81870BA: {OpTarget} was totally tight lipped. I haven't seen gums shut so tightly since I tried to wrestle a narwhal. If {OpTargetFirstName} won't talk, then I will get a little dirty by going through {OpTargetFirstName}'s mail.

   [93B] 0xE563CD5A748D8B7B: Typically, the existence of a check for an unreasonably large sum of money is a clear sign of foul play. It's addressed to the chef, but signed by {OpSource}…a local politician. I smell corruption and it stinks. I should conduct a stakeout around City Hall.

   [943] 0xC4C675BCACD6C605: I'm dumbfounded by what I've just seen. It's a conspiracy implicating local politicians, pharmaceutical corporations, farmers, and restaurants. This isn't good! This is way bigger than me, which means I need to tell {OpTarget}, a local journalist.

   [947] 0x93BAF8A390D311A2: {OpTarget} was sad to hear about the amount of corruption stemming from City Hall, not to mention the health pandemic the public must endure. {OpTarget} guarantees changes will come, and soon. I was paid handsomely for solving the case, but most importantly, I'm glad I did something good for my fellow Sim.
   [948] 0xFC9944CB77ABA566: The journalist will be writing the article as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I need to tell {OpTarget}, a high up politician, about the corruption in City Hall. This mutant food conspiracy ends now!

   [A8D] 0xF7F978317CFB6D79: In a bizarre chain of events, an art student at {OpTarget} managed to get stuck in a solid block of clay. The School has called upon {OpOwner} to meticulously sculpt the student out of the block without injuring the fully pacified student.

   [A93] 0x116EB2DB8E354852: {OpTarget} is putting on a highbrow party soon and would like an ice sculpture as the centerpiece for the main table. {OpOwner} has a reputation as a solid ice sculptor and is in a prime position to deliver one to {OpTarget} for a nice profit.
   [A94] 0x2487506226EA6CD2: The Bistro isn't too impressed with {OpOwner}'s lack of timely initiative in this errand. Because of this they had to go with another sculptor's piece. Hopefully this won't sever ties for potential jobs in the future!

   [A9D] 0xBB79742F0E18AC4A: {OpTarget} was happy to receive the new Sculpture -- it came out very well! There was some leftover Scrap that {OpTarget} is more than glad to give to {OpOwner}.
   [A9E] 0x70F03206B0285BFE: {OpTarget} was cleaning out some long forgotten closets, and unearthed a large amount of useful Scrap hidden beneath a pile of old clothing. {OpTarget} wants to know if {OpOwner} could make some sort of sculpture out of it?

   [AA2] 0x96187FB6F50EA2FD: {OpTargetFirstName} was fascinated seeing such a familiar face on the sculpture. {OpTargetFirstName} went over every detail of it with {OpOwner} to make sure everything was perfect. As expected, not a single piece of the sculpture was found wanting. 
   [AA3] 0x0796FE48AE4203F3: {OpTarget} has become philosophical recently, as well as a bit narcissistic. {OpTarget} desires something to remind friends and family of their own humanity, which means...an ice sculpture! {OpTargetFirstName} would like a personal ice sculpture made by {OpOwner}.

   [AA8] 0xFABACA11029BADBA: The {OpTarget} wants to try a new method of suspect identification. Instead of a sketched drawing, they want {OpOwner} to make a 3-D sculpture based on a witness' description. The {OpTarget} will pay {OpOwner} to come to the Police Station to sculpt the suspect.

   [AAE] 0x9776BA5FA9B5BB6C: Deliver an Ice Sculpture of any Sim to the Police Station to earn a cash reward, a sculpting skill boost, and relationship boost with the Police Station employees.

   [AB1] 0x405ADB193C212FEC: The mighty CEO was quite pleased with the new "doorstop," though it is somewhat unwieldy. {OpTarget} noted that this is just the price one pays for power and prestige. {OpOwner} took the money, as well as the satisfaction of helping the CEO's employees work under a more content boss.
   [AB2] 0x6A6ADF8259528DC8: {OpOwner} received a call from a very lofty company. They recently saw a competitor with some fashion of exotic doorstop for their office and now that company wants one too. Made of stone! There's quite a bit of money to be made here if done correctly!
   [AB3] 0x754F028DC0E3E981: Deliver a Stone Sculpture to the Business Office for a cash reward and relationship boost with the Business Office employees.

   [AB6] 0xF108B0C1CB72D225: A rather dangerous looking and large fellow accepted the sculptures, but was unhappy to discover they weren't hollow. {OpOwner} had to spend some extra time to hollow them out before leaving.
   [AB7] 0x04738D4B703B4C4B: A sketchy sounding fellow from {OpTarget} contacted {OpOwner}. The Sim would like {OpNumItemsGoal} Wood Sculptures delivered for an "art project." Someone in the background mentioned Troy and a huge horse, but that's probably not important.
   [AB8] 0xC37FD1EA4353FDE0: Deliver {OpNumItemsGoal} Wood Sculptures to the Warehouse to receive a cash reward, a sculpting skill boost, and relationship boost with the Warehouse employees.

   [ABB] 0xF683F1AE405E30BF: I wouldn't even know the supermarket is out of fruit -- I've been buying them from {OpTarget} lately.
   [ABC] 0xF683F1AE405E30BC: Why buy from the supermarket when {OpTarget} has the best prices? The real crime here is price gouging!
   [ABD] 0xF683F1AE405E30BD: I love to buy fresh fruit from {OpTarget}. Always a smile and low prices!
   [ABE] 0x97C17F5BCC1C9EF0: That referee, {OpTarget} has never called an honest game as far as I'm concerned. Total skeezebag. 
   [ABF] 0x97C17F5BCC1C9EF3: I stopped caring about local sports when that {OpTarget} took charge. It just kills the enjoyment from the games.
   [AC0] 0x97C17F5BCC1C9EF2: That referee, {OpTarget} is dirtier than my uncle's toilet. So you know, that's really dirty.
   [AC1] 0xA4DF21C9F4BBCCA8: I loved {OpSource} and cast my vote accordingly. I was really sad when {OpSource} lost.
   [AC2] 0xA4DF21C9F4BBCCAB: It was a shame to see {OpSource} lose the election. {OpSource} was the real champion of the people.
   [AC3] 0xA4DF21C9F4BBCCAA: It seemed so odd that {OpSource} lost. I don't know a single person that didn't vote for {OpSource}.
   [AC4] 0xF8F88C0281BF6438: I went home with a nasty case of food poisoning the last time I ate at the bistro, which is odd because the chef typically takes such care with the food!
   [AC5] 0xF8F88C0281BF643B: The bistro is a fine place to eat. I've got no complaints.
   [AC6] 0xF8F88C0281BF643A: I'm not sure the bistro is taking care of their ingredients. I keep getting sick every time I go there. I'm not sure why I keep eating there, actually.
   [AC7] 0x829FD8FEB77C12E8: {OpTarget} is obsessed with sharks -- that's pretty much all I know.
   [AC8] 0x829FD8FEB77C12EB: {OpTarget} has been making shark costumes to wear for as long as I can remember. It's really odd, actually.
   [AC9] 0x829FD8FEB77C12EA: {OpTarget} hasn't had many big stories at the paper lately. Things aren't going so well!
   [ACA] 0xC0AAD59A2CDB6D2B: Oh that scientist? Yeah, I've seen that character sneaking around town lately.
   [ACB] 0xC0AAD59A2CDB6D28: I've seen the lab tech around town, but I don't know anything else. Sorry!

   [ACD] 0xCB5ED991EE9CC2C9: I don't know anything about a wallet. I cannot even find MY wallet!
   [ACE] 0xCB5ED991EE9CC2CA: Wallets are for chumps…and people with money. Unfortunately, I'm neither.
   [ACF] 0xCB5ED991EE9CC2CB: Yeah, I may know something about a missing wallet, but I'm not talking about it. Not to you.
   [AD0] 0xA4D8D6C91D77463C: I love credit cards! Would you like to offer me a card deal?
   [AD1] 0xA4D8D6C91D77463F: I don't know anything about credit cards. I only deal in cash, mostly out of the jar buried in my backyard.

   [AD3] 0xFD348D5C7A24D3FA: Proposing would be a terrible idea! Honestly, I don't know what he sees in that girl.
   [AD4] 0xFD348D5C7A24D3F9: It would never last… Or at least I hope it wouldn't.
   [AD5] 0x992DA40EBDC08A0B: That book sounds familiar. I think I saw it at the public library. 
   [AD6] 0x992DA40EBDC08A08: No, I don't recall seeing a book by that description. It sounds like a compelling read though!
   [AD7] 0x992DA40EBDC08A09: I thought I read that book at the bookstore not too long ago.
   [AD8] 0x89779EBCEF52A52C: Flamingo, flamingo, flamingo…no, I don't think I've seen one lately. Personally, I'd check near a body of water if I were you.
   [AD9] 0x89779EBCEF52A52F: Oh I just love flamingos! Beautiful birds, bright pink, great legs. What? No, I haven't seen one.
   [ADA] 0x89779EBCEF52A52E: I saw a flamingo at one of the ponds not long ago. One of the remote ponds, if I recall.
   [ADB] 0xFAD0245AC6109F69: Why would I care about a plastic lawn flamingo? Of course I don't know where it is.
   [ADC] 0xFAD0245AC6109F6A: Flamingos have to be one of the most gaudy choices in modern lawn furniture.
   [ADD] 0xFAD0245AC6109F6B: No, I haven't seen a flamingo. No, I won't be looking for one.
   [ADE] 0xC263A1BF7F894BEC: Oh, I'm simply in love with {OpTarget}! She's a real peach, a true sweet heart. Though, she isn't returning my calls lately.
   [ADF] 0xC263A1BF7F894BEF: {OpTarget} has won my heart a thousand times over. We have such a pure, devoted relationship together! Well, we were devoted when she was around.
   [AE0] 0xC263A1BF7F894BEE: {OpTarget} and I have been together for weeks. She just swooped into my life like a seagull of love. Funny how I haven't heard from her in a day or so…
   [AE1] 0xF3AE100A1B725A6C: Those two used to be great friends back in school, but they had a falling out. I don't think they talk anymore.
   [AE2] 0xF3AE100A1B725A6F: Oh, I've heard through the grapevine about that old feud. Those two are not friends anymore. 
   [AE3] 0x8E397F399E4A7B23: I haven't seen shoes like that, but {OpTarget} knows all about fashion.
   [AE4] 0x8E397F399E4A7B20: I hate shoes and only wear them because I fear glass more. But {OpTarget} would know.
   [AE5] 0x8E397F399E4A7B21: {OpTarget} is a great stylist -- I'm sure you could get your questions answered there.
   [AE6] 0x38F1BBA2D6428A67: What is this, junior high? I have no clue about {OpTarget}'s love life. 
   [AE7] 0x38F1BBA2D6428A64: I think {OpTarget} has a crush on anything with a pulse. So to answer your question…maybe?
   [AE8] 0x38F1BBA2D6428A65: {OpTarget} may have a thing for {OpSource}. I've seen {OpTarget} bat eyes a few times, if you get my drift.
   [AE9] 0x9C29405C1DA66F76: I hear {OpTarget} has been looking for love, but don't quote me on that.
   [AEA] 0x9C29405C1DA66F75: A date? For {OpSource}? You must be joking.
   [AEB] 0x9C29405C1DA66F74: I saw a classified listing from {OpTarget} a week or so back. Perhaps there's something there?
   [AEC] 0xCB20224ADC57DEAD: Oh, so you're saying {OpSource} ISN'T a llama brained gnome herder? I can accept that.
   [AED] 0xCB20224ADC57DEAE: Of course {OpSourceFirstName} isn't a llama brained gnome herder. I've been saying that for years.
   [AEE] 0xCB20224ADC57DEAF: Everyone knows llama brained gnome herders only exist in the Arctic. Nobody really believed what {OpTarget} was saying.
   [AEF] 0xD50D791CD201E241: Yeah, I've had some issues with food poisoning lately. I probably won't be shopping there any more.
   [AF0] 0xD50D791CD201E242: A good friend of mine became quite ill after eating at the bistro the other day. Something isn't right in the kitchen!
   [AF1] 0xD50D791CD201E243: I felt awful a day or so after eating at the diner last week. Their special sauce is literally killer.
   [AF2] 0x1928FE9463B762A6: I saw a flash of tattooed flesh, but I cannot give you any specifics.
   [AF3] 0x1928FE9463B762A5: The only thing I remember is a really unfortunate tattoo. Honestly, that sucker needs to be removed.
   [AF4] 0x1928FE9463B762A4: Yeah, I do remember seeing a suspicious person. I also remember a tattoo.
