   [1BD] 0xDDDFEB0334E60845: Just as cute as a button, this home features a full wrap around Victorian porch and is ready for a growing family. An unfinished attic leaves plenty of room to expand; it even comes with an adorable matching doll house!
   [1BE] 0xCFDA29EA7C8F8769: Basically, it's a family style house, basically. This ranch style home would fit in any subdivision or even in the country. It's a great starter house for a small family, basically.
   [1BF] 0x548A8B0F685227BE: Available for either a lifetime of bliss or an afternoon of ceremony, this charming cottage promises a little slice of heaven, or at least cake.
   [1C0] 0xA4480FD085700493: If a Sim’s home is their castle, than this is suitable for a small queen or king. Although this is a pleasant enough house, anyone should be worried about letting their teenage prince or princess sleep on the ground floor with their own entrance… and exit.
   [1C1] 0xC3D5493F67004301: Built at a time when houses had names, Elderstone is just the type of house for the grandkids to come and spend a night, perhaps in their mom's old room. It's just a little cluttered and the kitchen needs updating, but it could work for a young family as well.
   [1C2] 0xCF136E72147BAB86: It's not clear that the ideal place for your in-laws is over the garage, but it probably beats them living in the next bedroom! Stately and ever so appropriate, this home is perfect for the family who has too much and wants more.
   [1C3] 0xA0FF9EA3C19B3B23: Once you get the cornflakes out of the carpet and the crayon off the walls, this house could be a real suburban dream. As is, the calm exterior hides the riot inside.
   [1C4] 0x9C61D64B138A8D0D: Tally Ho! As fine a country cottage as there ever was, Rose Haven is the ideal place for a spot of tea or a game of cricket. If your Sims are lucky, they may just go in for a bit of snoggin' as well.
   [1C5] 0xAD5FB52CC4EA92BA: Medieval castle living at its finest, the Rookery has eschewed its avian residents in favor of more domesticated dwellers. A turret, a balcony, your own pond and a hidden reading nook are among this habitat's unique features.

   [1D3] 0x0C9750C116461E17: The Art Club is having an impromptu art-a-thon. It's a friendly competition for students to get together and create pieces in a certain amount of time. Winners get their paintings hung in the {OpTarget} and a really sweet painting by Lilly O’Houllihan. Does {OpOwner} want to participate?
