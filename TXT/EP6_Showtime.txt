As a low-maintenance companion at home or a low-maintenance, motionless backup dancer on-stage, the Sim-bot is one of a kind (unless you buy more).
   [0EE] 0x35857F1A6ED66A59: According to legend, the evil pirate Greenbeard found an old lamp containing a genie and, with his second wish, asked for a giant onyx gem (the first wish being WooHoo related (it was a long sea voyage), the third wish being “three more wishes”). Thus was created the Black Plumbob of lore. This replica reminds you to be careful what you wish for…
   [0EF] 0x9356BAA3BBE26550: Round head so shiny\nsadly so disposable\na pawn in their game.
   [0F0] 0xE7BEE62BA3569C88: This Decor8 sculpture, symbolizing all three planets in the known Sims universe — Boonitz, Dipthong and Earth — is both attractive and functional, as simply by virtue of owning it, it may make you seem smarter. Decorate your space… with Space!
   [0F1] 0xCEF8714F7E385A8C: It’s a beam of light! It’s a teleporter! No, wait it’s an interstellar dimensional transponding device! Keep your audience guessing with a ray of light so advanced the smarties at SimTech couldn’t figure out what it was. Or place it in your home and dazzle your visitors and make them question if you truly did move in from outer space. Either way the WhatIzIt?!? is guaranteed to confuse onlookers, or your Simoleons back!
   [0F2] 0x246F373E7AF45714: Quick and deadly queen\nwatchful warrior sees all\nbest and greatest hope.
   [0F3] 0x73714CCD9161FC5F: Without beginning or end, the Ring Tower is both finite and infinite. Whatever the rings represent for you - eternity, commitment, circuses, dirty bathtubs - this exquisite sculpture will be an eternal reminder.
   [0F4] 0x85FA681B9655076E: Decor8 invites you to relive the excitement and romance of the Cold War Era with this new Rocketship sculpture! The whimsical design, inspired by early Nuclear Warhead schematics, features sassy striping and colorful accents. As a stage prop, a conversation piece, or something to hang your clothes on, the Decor8 Rocketship will have you blasting off for fun!
   [0F5] 0x812350A3B1539335: Strong, steady fortress\nupholds the future, unmoved\nprotects ancient kings.
   [0F6] 0x14037731F071A644: This vintage prop was once owned by Jacques Serrat, the infamous illusionist. Those who saw him perform say his Saw Box trick was incredibly realistic. This prop can no longer be used without a Certificate of Sanity, but makes an exciting conversation piece or stage prop.
   [0F7] 0x25663322C9D6756E: Have you ever dreamed of living under the sea, riding the wild currents on your trusty seahorse? No? Well, regardless, with the Mer-Made Seahorse Sculpture, Sims can get all the enjoyment of owning a seahorse without the hassle of being underwater.
   [0F8] 0x9A69A3943CFAD469: Those who’ve never seen the Social Bunny may think it’s just another fictional rabbit. Not so! While it is true it only appears to the loneliest of Sims, the existence of a statue of it proves that it’s real!
   [0F9] 0x72F8E2E87EC0DCFD: If it's worth sayin', it's worth sprayin'! If you have something big to say, do it with this big can of compressed street cred!
   [0FA] 0x757C24266E58BD5A: Blackfyre presents a window into the days of yore: a stained-glass sculpture from a bygone age, its warm glow hinting at a roaring hearth inside a manor, with a mutton shank sizzling on a spit, flagons of nectar, loud and off-key singing, even louder and more off-key women… or, you know, whatever.
   [0FB] 0x591C639720334538: Whether you're singing in the rain or just a lost tourist, this street sign will help you find your way. At the intersection of stardom and fame, follow this sign to greatness!
   [0FC] 0xD69C77CC587F15BE: The latest in plastic confections, Om Nom Nom Inc.'s new Sundae is vastly superior to their previous model, the Mondae. Where the Mondae tended to inspire feelings of trepidation and ennui, the Sundae conjures up more calming images of diners and poodle skirts.
   [0FD] 0x3D09889E43FE57AF: Made from real wood and stenciled by hand, this vintage Old West dynamite crate is a blast (but not literally)! No matter how you use it - as a stage prop, decoration or just an uncomfortable, splintery piece of furniture - the TNT box will blow people away! (But not literally.)
   [0FE] 0x86152544B63F0FD1: This piece – the latest masterpiece by Glass Act ingénue Jephrey von Hipsburg – defies interpretation. Is it a scepter, evoking power and majesty? A microphone, signifying voice and expression? A sugar cone? An alien flashlight? Art is in the eye of beholder, so you should be holding this!
   [0FF] 0xF069444C169E0734: Protect yourself from the harsh glare of indoor lighting with a stylish umbrella on your dining table. Or if your Sims prefer to eat outside, this umbrella can provide some shade from the sun's light.
   [100] 0x3A22D0442003A9F6: Does your patio table suffer from premature fading or embarrassing moisture? Protect it from the elements with this festive patio table umbrella! Now your food can relax outdoors in the dry shade of a Girasol Parasol!

   [102] 0xB44C48F047036648: If you wanna be copasetic, you gotta dig the Retro Geometro wall panel. The swingin’ pattern will get any pad into the groove. Order it up and in two ticks you’ll have a wall that’s outta this world!
   [103] 0xEE9A09FF19D2F9B2: No room has looked so sweet as a room decorated with The Anyothername Rose. A prim example of beauty personified, this rose is the epitome of elegance. 
   [104] 0x412BF6F5C69D30FC: White flowers symbolize purity, innocence, and never taking any risks. And there is no safer choice than a Wallflowers Planter. Three tiers of flowers provides coverage of a larger vertical area, and minimizes any one flower from standing out from the bunch.
   [105] 0x83E18F0ED5017780: As they say: “Music calms the savage beast” (though, actually, at some point in history there was a typo because the real quote is “Music calms the savage breast,” but, hey, it works either way, right?). This neon creation by The Light Fantastic may not sedate wild animals (or de-stress your torso), but its cool design and vibrant colors are definitely easy on the eyes.
   [106] 0xDBC8BE9D0E11E82E: Hang this eye-catching neon on your wall and open a window to a bustling boulevard in some exotic foreign city. You’ll swear you hear taxis honking and the sounds of street vendors whenever you turn on the neon.
   [107] 0x96D61C8D6E82C0DE: Nothing will jazz up your joint like this neon sign by The Light Fantastic. The classic trumpet design – harkening back to a romantic era of speakeasies, fedoras and virtuosos with names like Armstrong, Davis and Charlie “Bird” Parker – hits all the right notes.

   [11A] 0x4D96222EF09D31FC: Despite having the word “skee,” this game is in fact played without skis. It does involve a ball, and most Sims agree that it’s a super fun game. Roll the ball down the lane and get it into the hole to score points. Easy enough for a Child Sim to play, but difficult for even an Elder Sim to master!
   [11B] 0xF3502790FE364928: You’ll flip for the Swellegant Sofa! It’s a modern marvel - efficient, sophisticated, and thoroughly laboratory-tested to ensure the comfort of family members of all ages. This sofa is perfect addition to any pad, and that’s the word from the bird!
   [11C] 0xE6448A47596DCE8B: The delicate iron scrolling encases this sofa much like a wall of briars, and the cushions are so comfortable, it would be easy to sink down and sleep for a hundred years.

With its stylish lines, delicious striping and just a hint of peppermint fragrance, the Sugar Shack Ribbon Candy Couch is perfect for those with a sweet tooth and an eye for elegance!
   [11F] 0xCE568FB50B69889E: Only the biggest stars can sell out a stadium of this size. Arenas rock!

   [127] 0xBAB64CBD130787DC: The Keane 35 Watt Sound Enhancer will not just duplicate sound, it will enhance it! Not by making it louder or better, but by making it more like it was before the enhancer was used.
   [128] 0x724545C59D04EBE7: How does sound reach this amazing speaker? Magic, that’s how! Turn your home into an audiophile’s dream with one of these in every room. As a bonus, this fantastic speaker is compatible with stereos of all makes and models. Don’t have a stereo? No problem! But don’t expect the Satellite Speaker to make a sound…

   [12A] 0xAA2D5F6D726F0268: Inspiration for this piece came from a visit to a hip dentist’s office. If you dig oral hygiene – and who doesn’t? – there is no better way to complete your living room. Plus, you already bought the End Table, right?
   [12B] 0x0CD97F7AD330F941: This coffee table is stylish enough for a princess, but still sturdy enough to survive the abuses of a gaggle of sons.

   [12D] 0x66A2DB8D0C8E1A90: Learning from previous mistakes, Om Nom Nom Inc. made this eclair scratch-proof, stain-proof, smear-proof, unmeltable, and completely inedible. 
   [12E] 0xA3493EE71C0B8E76: Old West Mercantile uses only the finest quality straw to make their decorative hay bales. But wait! It's also a fully functional coffee table! Crazy? Maybe! But some pigs have been known to construct entire houses out of this stuff!
   [12F] 0xC6CAA1368E77D27D: This table begins with curving legs inspired by famous rockets of Science Fiction, carved from high-quality wood. These legs support a hard glass top which can hold any dish a Sim can bake.

   [131] 0x0923BFC5D656A666: A cube within a cube with a twist, this table is definitely not for squares. This kookie table is nothing short of functional art. Be sure to pick up a matching chair so you have somewhere to sit while you eyeball its way-out design.
   [132] 0x7C18E7832D15FED9: The detailed construction of this table simply screams royalty.

   [133] 0x4F88EBA44F99DD4B: Show off your good taste with a Gumdrop table top by Sugar Shack. Covered with a sparkly sugarcoated finish, you can almost feel it sticking to your teeth! No matter what kind of stuff you put on it, this confection-inspired table will look totally sweet in your house or on a stage!
   [134] 0x7D207DF9F3BAE641: The designers at SimTech Industries thought, “Why not make our next mass-storage decoration look like a simple box with rubber safety corners?” And so they did. Years of painstaking research went into the development of the Bio-Cube to find a way for Sims to safely place this powerful device on their show stages without risk of radiation poisoning, then they realized that it makes a very nice end table as well. 
   [135] 0x8AE3F53E4E9CEDB9: Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of the Sopha Soft ottoman. This four-in-one powerhouse does it all: set a drink on it, put up your feet (no dirty shoes, please!), seat an entire family or, in a pinch, brace a door in case of a zombie attack!

   [333] 0xD49A23818C96AA4E: Forget those multi-level modern monstrosities. This modern style house will really make you feel modern… 1960s modern that is! Step outside and be surrounded by an expansive backyard. Step inside and enjoy the view of the backyard through the wall of large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The carpeting may be out of date, but this house will always be in style!
   [334] 0xBD82F4C71B591D6C: There’s nothing fancy about this house; it’s a utilitarian bungalow style home priced for a Sim who wants a sturdy house without any frills.

   [335] 0x66D162AD7E33BDC4: Straight off the truck and onto your lawn, this prefab is great for Sims who spend lots of time away from home.

   [336] 0x23296DCE10513066: A modest pad for a modest Sim, this well-built prefab has stood the test of time. Though the kitchen is small and the bathroom barely fits one, the gigantic living room sets this beauty apart from other budget homes.

   [3BD] 0xCABE78739969FCF4: The Woods aren’t always the most popular family on the block.

Now that Ariella’s found something she's good at, she’s starting to think about settling down. She loves Mithun and hopes they'll one day have a family together, but wonders if Mithun will ever grow up and put their relationship before his mooch of a best friend, Ernesto.

   [3D2] 0x7ECE309E462E1B08: The newest addition to the Woods household, August is outgoing and easily excited by even the most basic of illusion tricks.

   [3D7] 0x9270525CAD747825: Since Barry can remember, he’s always had a guitar in his hand practicing his favorite tunes.

   [664] 0x9CD1EF15E4474CFD: The Big Boss was very impressed with your invisible box routine… until he realized you weren’t actually in a box. Using your methods, his henchman can only escape from imaginary jail cells.

   [678] 0x34FC963C9EFC36AB: The “Value Days” Sale is over and so is your chance to perform. Creamed corn is still on sale, though.

   [693] 0x63A54C3977287BC2: The “Greatest Show on Perth” premiere was a big hit, though you would have stolen the show!
   [694] 0x90E7BE1A59EB4486: You needed a little pampering. Now your muscles are ready for some crazy new acrobatics!
   [695] 0xBF4278B65A684E12: The Spa is running a promotion: one free pampering treatment. Now would be a good time to relax your muscles before you start learning some really crazy acrobatic stunts!
   [696] 0xC341C5141E58A3A7: Go the Spa to complete this opportunity.
   [697] 0xB130901413E7120D: Happy Pamper
   [698] 0x826CACDD01412AAD: DNT
   [699] 0x77C1928E67BF5005: This opportunity is no longer available.
   [69A] 0x1AD1D938B82B9C07: Keeping the school kids entertained was harder than juggling cats. Maybe next time you should try actually juggling cats. They’d probably like that. 
   [69B] 0xD5FCEE7476B5F625: It’s Physical Fitness Week at the School. You’ve been invited to teach kids some fun activities that don’t require a TV, computer, or game console.
   [69C] 0x54D1D47B8D01A73E: Go to the School to teach juggling to kids.
   [69D] 0x671A297B97A2B1E0: Tricks are for Kids
   [69E] 0xA8E845A7224186EC: DNT
   [69F] 0x0E0B3B1F0F10EE36: The School Physical Fitness Week has ended. Get back to the couch!
   [6A0] 0x97A937482C685C92: After a few hours in the gym, you’re looking great, and you're ready to make some serious tip money.
   [6A1] 0x33C3F67680BE42F6: Very few of the world’s greatest acrobats are chubby and inflexible. Hitting the gym will make you stronger and more limber, and it will help you become a better acrobat. It won’t hurt your love life either. 
   [6A2] 0x83DD493575921FCE: This opportunity is no longer available.
   [6A3] 0xBB4418BC835B660B: Go to the Gym and work out.
   [6A4] 0xEE490BBC9FFCC289: Feel the Burn
   [6A5] 0x3686EC8CB56B2D79: Go to the Gym and work out.
   [6A6] 0x4B581118A54127B2: After enduring the bitter cold and near frostbitten fingers, you noticed the lamp looked slightly different. More importantly, both you and the genie felt a change in the magic surrounding the lamp and could tell it was time to prepare for the next step in your quest to free the genie.
   [6A7] 0x60992B5DA07FAF96: The genie cannot break the chains of the lamp alone! You must destroy the lamp together, but it will not be an easy process. To weaken the lamp, first you must freeze it in the breath of coldest winter!
   [6A8] 0xAB27E1944222CA6E: This opportunity is no longer available.
   [6A9] 0x1BA4C49E1868CA2B: Place the genie lamp in the refrigerator to “Freeze the Lamp.”
   [6AA] 0x520EB79E37EB9CA9: Free the Genie
   [6AB] 0x8AF275A24F3D1A99: Freeze the Lamp
   [6AC] 0x8841EA9AFD7D5EC7: You could feel the blistering heat as you watched the lamp cook like a stuffed turkey, until a slight shift in the atmosphere alerted you and the genie to its unstable state. 
   [6AD] 0x63C25089D4BE1DE5: The genie cannot break the chains of the lamp alone! The lamp is weaker now, but still cannot be overcome. Next, you must burn the lamp in the heat of a thousand fires!
   [6AE] 0xE0281BC79BDDCF99: This opportunity is no longer available.
   [6AF] 0xB1789B103CFEA4FE: Place the genie lamp in the oven to “Heat the Lamp.”
   [6B0] 0xC059F01044BAD2A0: Free the Genie
   [6B1] 0xF50C18D0275017AC: Heat the Lamp
   [6B2] 0x686D16B7EF3A2A52: It's a good thing genies are magical creatures, otherwise you both might not have survived the grueling tasks it took to break the lamp! Your summons have allowed the genie to break its bonds with one last mighty heave and escape to freedom.
   [6B3] 0x2955BEF32351C9B6: Your perseverance has paid off. The bonds are weak! Act now to set your friend free!
   [6B4] 0x9492DE0E7B93538E: This opportunity is no longer available.

   [6B7] 0x98E09951E692F339: Summon the Genie
   [6B8] 0xAF98FBD9C44C3AE3: Monsters, lichen, and bears, oh my! Traveling through the catacombs was a hazardous experience, so it's no wonder the lamp finally gave up under the oppressive pressure of being underground.
   [6B9] 0x9612433040F08759: The genie cannot break the chains of the lamp alone! The lamp is weaker now, but still its hold still will not break. Your final task is to plunge the lamp into the darkness below the earth, where the walking dead lurk!
   [6BA] 0x412F2209FC8B48B5: This opportunity is no longer available.
